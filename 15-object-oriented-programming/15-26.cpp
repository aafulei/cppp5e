// Exercise 15.26: Define the Quote and Bulk_quote copy-control members to do
// the same job as the synthesized versions. Give them and the other
// constructors print statements that identify which function is running. Write
// programs using these classes and predict what objects will be created and
// destroyed. Compare your predictions with the output and continue
// experimenting until your predictions are reliably correct.
