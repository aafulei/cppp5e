**Exercise 13.9:** What is a destructor? What does the synthesized destructor do? When is a destructor synthesized?

**Answer:** A destructor of a class does whatever work is needed to *supplement* the implicit memberwise destruction of an object when the object is destroyed. For example, it may free the resources used by a member of the object, which is not freed automatically following the destruction of that member. A synthesized destructor does nothing. It is synthesized when the class does not define one.

**Exercise 13.10:** What happens when a `StrBlob` object is destroyed? What about a `StrBlobPtr`?

**Answer:** Both rely on the synthesized destructor.

- For a `StrBlob`, `data` will be destroyed as a result of the implicit memberwise destruction. The use count of the shared pointer will be decremented by 1. Since `data` is a shared pointer, if the use count becomes 0, the `vector<string>` will be destroyed, and resources will be freed. The synthesized destructor itself does nothing in addition.
- For a `StrBlobPtr`, `wptr` and `curr` will be destroyed as a result of the implicit memberwise destruction. The use count of the shared pointer to which the weak pointer `wptr` points will remain unchanged. The synthesized destructor itself does nothing in addition.
