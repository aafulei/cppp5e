**Exercise 2.5:** Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:

(a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"

(b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC

(c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L

(d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2

**Answer:**

(a) `char`,  `wchar_t`,  `char const [2]`, `wchar_t const [2]`

(b) `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`, `int`, `int`  (the last two are octal and hexadecimal)

(c) `double`, `float`, `long double`

(d) `int`, `unsigned int`, `double`, `double`

**Exercise 2.6:** What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:

```c++
int month = 9, day = 7;
int month = 09, day = 07;
```

**Answer:** Decimal 9 and 7. Invalid and octal 7.

**Exercise 2.7:** What values do these literals represent? What type does each have?

(a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"

(b) 3.14e1L

(c) 1024f

(d) 3.14L

**Answer:**

(a) Who goes with Fergus? (newline) `char const [23]`

(b) 31.4 `long double`

(c)  Invalid (1024 is an integral literal, not a floating-point literal)

(d) 3.14 `long double`
