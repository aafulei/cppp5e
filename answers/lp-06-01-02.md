**Exercise 6.1:** What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

**Answer:**

- parameter: also called *"formal argument"*. Local variables defined in the function's parameter list, which are initialized from the arguments provided in the function call.
- argument: also called *"actual argument".* Values supplied in the function call, which are used to initialize the function's parameters.

**Exercise 6.2:** Indicate which of the following functions are in error and why. 
Suggest how you might correct the problems.

(a) 

```c++
int f() {
     string s;
     // ...
     return s;
 }
```

**Answer:** Return type is `int`, but returns a `string`. May change return type from `int` to `string`.

(b)

```c++
f2(int i) { /* ... */ }
```

**Answer:** Missing return type in the definition. May specify return type as `void` if nothing to return.

(c)

```c++
int calc(int v1, int v1) /* ... */ }
```

**Answer:** Duplicated names in parameter list. May change `v1` to `v2`.

(d)

```c++
double square(double x) return x * x;
```

**Answer:** Missing curly braces for the function body. May add a pair of curly braces around the body.
