#### Chapter 10 Generic Algorithms

The generic algorithms do not themselves execute container operations. They operate solely in terms of *iterators* and iterator operations. They do not change the size of a container directly.

> What does "generic" mean as in "generic algorithms"?

It operates on different types of elements and across different types of containers.

##### 10.1 Overview

> What's the problem with
>
> ```c++
> string s = "How do you do?";
> auto it = find(s.begin(), s.end(), "do");
> ```

We cannot use `std::find` defined in `<algorithm>` to find a `string` in a `string`. To do so, use

```c++
auto pos = s.find("do"); // pos is a string::size_type
```

Note that it returns an index, not an iterator.

##### 10.2 A First Look at the Algorithms

> Where is `std::accumulate` defined?

`<numeric>`

> What's the difference if we pass `0.` rather than `0` as the last argument for `std::accumulate`?

Floating-number addition rather than integral addition.

> Use `accumulate` to concatenate all strings in `v`, which is a `vector<string>`.

```c++
string sum = accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), string(""));
```

> What's the problem with
>
> ```c++
> vector<int> v;
> fill_n(v.begin(), 10, 0);
> ```
> 
> How to fix it?

`fill_n` assumes there is room to write but there is not. To fix it,

```c++
vector<int> v;
fill_n(back_inserter(v), 10, 0);
```

> What is a `back_inserter`? What does it take and return?

It takes a container and returns an insert iterator `it`. `it` can be used as an iterator, but when we assign via `it`, we call `push_back` to add the element.

> Where is `back_inserter` defined? Do you know what else is also defined in that header?

`<iterator>`

`std::begin()` and `std::end()` which may apply to built-in arrays.

> Assume `a` and `b` are built-in arrays of the same size. Copy `a` to `b`.

```c++
copy(begin(a), end(a), begin(b));
// alternatively:
// copy(a, a + sizeof a / sizeof a[0], b);
```

> Assume `u` and `v` are `vector<string>`. What does the following line do?
>
> ```c++
> replace_copy(u.cbegin(), u.cend(), back_inserter(v), string("colour"), string("color"));
> ```

Append `u` to `v`, replacing every `"colour"` with `"color"` in the appended strings.

##### 10.3 Customizing Operations

> What is a predicate?

An expression that can be called and returns a value that can be used as a condition.

> Give one algorithm that uses a unary predicate and one algorithm that uses a binary predicate.

- unary predicate: `std::partition`
- binary predicate: `std::sort`

> What does `stable_sort` do?

Sort the elements, keeping the order of equal elements untouched.

> What is the type of a lambda expression?

Unspecified.

> Do yo agree with the following statement? Why?
>
> *Lambda is just a fancy way to write short functions. Wherever a lambda is used, we could substitute a function for it.*

Not really. For example, generic algorithms require unary or binary predicates, but in many cases, it would be very difficult, if possible at all, to write a function that takes only one or two arguments to encompass all the information we need. Using a lambda we could capture information from the surrounding scope.

> What must be supplied in the structure of a lambda expression?

The capture list `[]` and the function body `{}`.

> What is the return type of
>
> ```c++
> [](int i){ i *= 2; }
> ```

`void`

> What is the output of

```c++
0 0
0 2
2 1
```

*The value of a captured variable is copied when the lambda is created, not when it is called.*

> Write a function that returns a lambda.

```c++
#include<functional>
function<int(int)> make_lambda(int a)     // alternatively in C++14: auto make_lambda(int a)
{	return [a](int b){ return a + b; }; }
int main()
{
    cout << make_lambda(42)(24) << endl;  // 66
    return 0;
}
```

> A fragment of code shows
>
> ```c++
> cout << f(1)(2)(3) << endl;
> ```
>
> How could that be possible? Write one version of `f` to make the above line legal.

`f` could be a function that takes an `int` and returns a nested lambda, which is a lambda that takes an `int` and returns a lambda, which takes an `int` and returns an `int`.

```c++
#include<functional>
function<function<int(int)>(int)> f(int a)  // alternatively in C++14: auto f(int a)
{
	return [a](int b)
	{
		return [a, b](int c)
		{
			return a + b + c;
		};
	};
}
int main()
{
    cout << f(1)(2)(3) << endl;	// 6
    return 0;
}
```

> What does `std::for_each` do? Use it to print out all the elements in a container `c`.

It takes an iterator range and a callable object as its parameters. It calls that object on each element in the range.

```c++
for_each(c.cbegin(), c.cend(),
        [](const decltype(c)::value_type & e)
        {cout << e << " ";});
```

*There is no need to capture `c` if we only use it in `decltype` in the lambda.*

> Assume `s` is a `string`.  In one statement remove all the non-alphabetical characters in `s`.

```c++
s.erase(remove_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](char c){ return !isalpha(c); }), s.end());
```

> Assume `s` is a `string`. In one statement convert all the uppercase letters to lowercase. 

```c++
transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), [](char c){ return toupper(c); });
```

*No `&` is needed for `c` in the parameter list, because `transform` is responsible to store that value from `s.begin()`.*

> Use an example to explain the placeholder in a `std::bind()`.

Consider

```c++
#include <functional>
using std::bind;
using namespace std::placeholders;
void f(int a, double b, char c);
auto g = bind(f, 42, _2, _1);
```

To call

```c++
g('c', 3.14);
```

is equivalent to call

```c++
f(42, 3.14, 'c');
```

In a word, 

1. the arguments in `bind()` are function name `f` and arguments for `f()` as in the original order;
2. the order of placeholders correspond to the order of parameters in `g()`.

> Consider
>
> ```c++
> void print(ostream & os, const vector<int> & v);
> ```
>
> Use `std::bind()` to construct a new callable `f` that takes an empty parameter list but does the same thing as `print()`.

```c++
auto f = std::bind(print, std::ref(os), std::cref(v));
```

For example,

```c++
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std::placeholders;
using std::cout;
using std::cref;
using std::endl;
using std::ostream;
using std::ref;
using std::vector;

void print(ostream & os, const vector<int> & v)
{
	for (auto e : v)
		os << e << " ";
	os << endl;
}

int main()
{
	vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	auto f = bind(print, ref(cout), cref(v));
	f();
}
```

> How to negate a predicate supplied by `std::bind()`?

All the names in what follows are in the namespace `std`.

Suppose the `bind` returns a function object that takes an `int`.

- nested `bind`: `bind(logical_not<bool>(), bind(...))`


- since C++17: `not_fn(bind(...))`
- deprecated in C++17: `not1<function<bool(int)>>(bind(...))`

> Use stream iterators to read `cin` to a vector of `int`, and then print the vector to `cout`, with each element separated by a blank.

```c++
istream_iterator isit(cin), isend;
ostream_iterator osit(cout, " ");
vector<int> vec(isit, isend);
copy(vec.cbegin(), vec.cend(), osit);
```

> vector<int> v2(isit2, isend);

>

> ```

(B) and (C) are both possible.

*When we bind an `istream_iterator` to a stream, we are not guaranteed that it will read the stream immediately. The implementation is permitted to delay reading the stream until we use the iterator. On one hand, in this case, `isit2` could start reading `cin` at any time between its initialization and its usage as an argument to initial `v2`. On the other hand, once an `int` is read from the stream, it's gone. There is no way it appears both on `v1` and `v2`.*

> Let `s` be a `string` of comma-separated words. It is also possible that `s` is empty. Use `std::find()` to print the first  and the last words in `s`.

```c++
cout << string(s.cbegin(), find(s.cbegin(), s.cend(), ',')) << endl;
cout << string(find(s.crbegin(), s.crend(), ',').base(), s.cend()) << endl;
```

> Let `r` be a `reverse_iterator`. Do `r` and `r.base()` refer to the same element?

No. `r.base()` refers to the one past the element that `r` refers to, so that `[r.base(), c.cend())` and `[c.crbegin(), r)` represent the same iterator range. (Assume `c` is the container.)

> Given `v` is a `vector<int>`, what is the return type of `std::find(v.crbegin(), v.crend(), 42);`?

`vector<int>::const_reverse_iterator`.

##### 10.5 Structure of Generic Algorithms

> List the five categories of iterators.

|      Iterator       | Input  |         Output         |  Forward  | Bidirectional | Random-access |
| :-----------------: | :----: | :--------------------: | :-------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
|        read         |   O    |           X            |     O     |       O       |       O       |
|        write        |   X    |           O            |     O     |       O       |       O       |
|     multi-pass      |   X    |           X            |     O     |       O       |       O       |
|      decrement      |   X    |           X            |     X     |       O       |       O       |
| iterator arithmetic |   X    |           X            |     X     |       X       |       O       |
|  related examples   | `find` | destination in  `copy` | `replace` |   `reverse`   |    `sort`     |

*All the iterators must support increment and single-pass.*

> What category of iterators does `std::replace()` require at minimum?

Forward iterators.

> What is the difference between an input iterator and a read-only forward iterator?

- An input iterator is one-pass, which means that you cannot iterate through one element twice. Consider a stream iterator for the standard input. Once you read an `int` via it, there is no way to read that `int` again. 
- A forward iterator is multi-pass. Consider a forward iterator to a container. Suppose you have passed an element by repeatedly incrementing the iterator 3 times. You can repass that element by setting the iterator to the beginning of the container, and repeatedly incrementing 3 times again.
- In essence, input iterators are usually used to iterate over the ranges that don't have a material realization. That is, these elements do not actually exist somewhere in memory. Consider a network stream. When you process work on it with an iterator, you don't (and can't) store it in your memory.

> Why do you think the standard library provides `std::find_if()` besides `std::find()`, rather than simply overloading `std::find()` to kill two birds with one stone?

Both `find(beg, end, val)` and `find_if(beg, end, pred)` have three arguments. Overload may cause ambiguity.

##### 10.6 Container-Specific Algorithms

> For `list` and `forward_list`, which version of algorithm is faster -- container version or generic version? Why?

The container version is faster, because a list container can swap its elements simply by changing the links among the elements, rather than swapping the values of the elements.

> Compare the generic and container versions of `remove_if()` for a `list`.

1. The container version is faster.
2. The container version really removes, while the generic version only moves the unqualified elements to the back.
