**Exercise 2.35:** Determine the types deduced in each of the following definitions. Once youâ€™ve figured out the types, write a program to see whether you were correct.

```c++
const int i = 42;
auto j = i;
const auto &k = i;
auto *p = &i;
const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;
```

**Answer:**

`i` is a `const int`.

`j` is an ` int`.

`k` is a `const int &`.

`p` is a `const int *`.

`j2` is a `const int`.

`k2` is an `const int &`.

**Exercise 2.36:** In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value each variable has when the code finishes:

```c++
int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype((b)) d = a;
++c;
++d;
```

**Answer:** 

| name | type    | value when code finishes |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| `a`  | `int`   | 4                        |
| `b`  | `int`   | 4                        |
| `c`  | `int`   | 4                        |
| `d`  | `int &` | 4                        |

**Exercise 2.37:** Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if `i` is an `int`, then the type of the expression `i = x` is `int&`. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:

```c++
int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype(a = b) d = a;
```

**Answer:** 

| name | type    | value |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| `a`  | `int`   | 3     |
| `b`  | `int`   | 4     |
| `c`  | `int`   | 3     |
| `d`  | `int &` | 3     |

**Exercise 2.38:** Describe the differences in type deduction between `decltype` and `auto`. Give an example of an expression where `auto` and `decltype` will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types.

**Answer:** 

|                                        | `auto` | `decltype` |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Ignores top-level `const`?             | Yes    | No         |
| Ignores reference?                     | Yes    | No [^*]    |
| Depends on the form of the expression? | No     | Yes [^#]   |

[^*]: For an expression which is not a single variable and which yields a lvalue, `decltype` returns a reference type. For example, `decltype(*p)`, where `p` is an `int *`, would return an `int &`, not just a plain `int`.
[^#]: For example, given `a` is an `int`, `decltype(a)` returns an `int`, whereas `decltype((a))` returns an `int &`.

Deduce the same type:

```c++
int a = 3;
auto b = a;
decltype (a) c = a;
```

Deduce differing types:

```c++
int a = 3, *p = &a;
auto b = *p;
decltype(*p) c = *p;
```
