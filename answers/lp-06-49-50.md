**Exercise 6.49:** What is a candidate function? What is a viable function?

**Answer:** A candidate function is a function with the same name as the called function and for which the declaration is visible at the point of the call. A viable function in addition must have the same number of parameters as there are arguments in the call.

**Exercise 6.50:**  Given  the  declarations  for `f`  from  *page 242*,  list  the  viable functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the best match, or if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the call is ambiguous.

```c++
void f();
void f(int);
void f(int, int);
void f(double, double = 3.14);
```

(a) `f(2.56, 42)`

(b) `f(42)`

(c) `f(42, 0)`

(d) `f(2.56, 3.14)`

**Answer:** 

(a) viable functions: `f(int, int)` and `f(double, double = 3.14)`. Ambiguous call as there is no better match over the other.

(b) viable functions: `f(int)` and `f(double, double = 3.14)`. Best match is `f(int)` since the types of the parameter and the argument are identical.

(c) viable functions: `f(int, int)` and `f(double, double = 3.14)`. Best match is `f(int, int)` since the types of the parameters and the arguments are identical.

(d) viable functions: `f(int, int)` and `f(double, double = 3.14)`. Best match is `f(double, double = 3.14)` since the types of the parameters and the arguments are identical.
