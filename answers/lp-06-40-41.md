**Exercise 6.40:** Which, if either, of the following declarations are errors? Why?

(a) 

```c++
int ff(int a, int b = 0, int c = 0);
```

(b)

```c++
char *init(int ht = 24, int wd, char bckgrnd);
```

**Answer:** (b) is an error. Because we can only omit trailing arguments, if we had supplied a default argument for a parameter, we would have to supply default arguments for all the parameters following it.

*The general principle is to put the parameter that you are most likely to change first, and the one you are least likely to change last.*

**Exercise 6.41:** Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why? Which, if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmerâ€™s intent? Why?

```c++
char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');
```

(a) `init();`

(b) `init(24, 10);`

(c) `init(14, '*');`

**Answer:** (a) is illegal. (c) is unlikely to match the programmer's intent because `'*'` is supplied to as an argument to `wd`.
