// Exercise 16.53: Write your own version of the print functions and test them by printing one, two, and five arguments, each of which should have different types.

// Exercise 16.54: What happens if we call print on a type that doesnâ€™t have an << operator?

// Answer: Compilation error: no match for 'operator<<'.

// Exercise 16.55: Explain how the variadic version of print would execute if we declared the nonvariadic version of print after the definition of the variadic version.

// Answer: In general, this would cause a compilation error. When there is only one argument to be printed, the compiler would still instantiate the variadic version, since the non-variadic version is not in scope. That way, print(os, a ...) would be a call with an empty a, which hsa no matching call.

// To the contrary, suppose we have declared the non-variadic version beforehand. When there is only one argument to be printed, the compiler would instantiate the non-variadic version, since it is more specialized. This would terminate the printing process correctly.

// However, there seems to be an exception. Suppose the last argument has a class type (which has overloaded operator<<). It seems that even we haven't forward declared the non-variadic version, the compiler will still instantiate it. See postscript for details.
