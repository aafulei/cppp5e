**Exercise 7.36:** The following initializer is in error. Identify and fix the problem.

```c++
struct X {
	X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }
	int rem, base;
};
```

**Answer:** Members are initialized in the order in which they appear in the class definition. Thus `rem` is initialized before `base`. But the constructor initializer list initializes `rem` using value of `base`. To fix it, consider changing `int rem, base;` to `int base, rem;`.

**Exercise 7.37:** Using the version of Sales_data from this section, determine which constructor is used to initialize each of the following variables and list the values of the data members in each object:

```c++
Sales_data first_item(cin);
int main() {
	Sales_data next;
	Sales_data last("9-999-99999-9");
}
```

```c++
class Sales_data {
public:
    // defines the default constructor as well as one that takes a string argument
    Sales_data(std::string s = ""): bookNo(s) { }
    // remaining constructors unchanged
    Sales_data(std::string s, unsigned cnt, double rev):
          bookNo(s), units_sold(cnt), revenue(rev*cnt) { }
    Sales_data(std::istream &is) { read(is, *this); }
    // remaining members as before
};
```

**Answer:**  `Sales_data(std::istream &is)` for `first_item`. Values according to `cin`.

`Sales_data(std::string s = "")` for `next` and `last`. `bookNo` is `""` and `"9-999-99999-9"` for `next` and `last` respectively. Other data members are 0.
