**Exercise 13.24:** What would happen if the version of `HasPtr` in this section didn’t define a destructor? What if `HasPtr` didn’t define the copy constructor?

```c++
class HasPtr {
public:
    HasPtr(const string &s = string()) : ps(new string(s)), i(0) { }
    HasPtr(const HasPtr &p) : ps(new string(*p.ps)), i(p.i) { }
    HasPtr& operator=(const HasPtr &);
    ~HasPtr() { delete ps; }
private:
    string *ps;
    int i;
};
```

**Answer:** If `HasPtr` didn't define a destructor, the compiler would synthesize one. However, there would be memory leaks as the memory dynamically allocated for `*ps` is not freed when an object of `HasPtr` is destructed by the synthesized destructor.

If `HasPtr` didn't define the copy constructor, the compiler would synthesize one. However, this could be problematic, because all the copies would share the same memory for `*ps`. If one copy is destructed, its `ps` will be deleted by the destructor. This would invalidate all the other `ps` at the same time.
