**Exercise 3.27:** Assuming `txt_size` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an `int` value, which of the following definitions are illegal? Explain why.

`unsigned buf_size = 1024;`

(a) `int ia[buf_size];`

(b) `int ia[4 * 7 - 14];`

(c) `int ia[txt_size()];`

(d) `char st[11] = "fundamental";`

**Answer:** (a) and (d) are illegal, (c) is also illegal unless `txt_size()` is a constant expression.

(a) is illegal because `buf_size` is not `const`. 

(c) is illegal, unless `txt_size()` is a constant expression, because the `int` value returned is not know at compile time.

(d) is illegal because `st` does not have enough space to hold `"fundamental"`, which terminates with a null character, and has a size of 12.

**Exercise 3.28:** What are the values in the following arrays?
```c++
string sa[10]
int ia[10];
int main() {
      string sa2[10];
      int    ia2[10];
}
```

**Answer:** 

- `sa` 10 empty strings
- `ia` 10 zeros
- `sa2` 10 empty strings
- `ia2` 10 undefined `int` values

**Exercise 3.29:** List some of the drawbacks of using an array instead of a `vector`.

**Answer:**

1. fixed size, which has to be known at compile time
2. no assignment using `=`
3. array-to-pointer conversion leads to a loss in dimension

**Exercise 3.30:** Identify the indexing errors in the following code:

```c++
constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
int ia[array_size];
for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
	ia[ix] = ix;
```

**Answer:** Accessing `ia[array_size]` is an undefined behavior.
