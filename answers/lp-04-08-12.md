**Exercise 4.8:** Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND, logical OR, and equality operators.

**Answer:**

| `a && b`                                 | `a || b`                                 | `a == b`                                 |
| :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| short-circuit evaluation: `b` is evaluated if and only if `a` is `true` | short-circuit evaluation: `b` is evaluated if and only if `a` is `false` | `a` and `b` are both evaluated; which part is first evaluated is undefined |

**Exercise 4.9:** Explain the behavior of the condition in the following `if`:

```c++
const char *cp = "Hello World";
if (cp && *cp)
```

**Answer:** Since `cp` points to something (not a null pointer), `cp` yields `true` as a condition. `*cp` returns `'H'`, which is a `char`, which is converted to `true` since the value is nonzero. Thus condition is `true`. It is equivalent to checking if "`cp` points to anything other than a null character".

**Exercise 4.10:** Write the condition for a `while` loop that would read `int`s from the standard input and stop when the value read is equal to 42.

**Answer:** 

```c++
int a;
while (std::cin >> a && a != 42)
```

**Exercise 4.11:**  Write  an  expression  that  tests  four values, `a`, `b`, `c`,  and  `d`, and  ensures  that  `a`  is  greater  than  `b`,  which  is  greater  than  `c`,  which  is greater than `d`.

**Answer:** 

```c++
a > b && b > c && c > d
```

**Exercise 4.12:** Assuming `i`, `j`, and `k` are all `int`s, explain what `i != j < k` means.

**Answer:** The expression is `true` if:

1. `j` is less than `k`, and `i` is not 1, OR
2. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `i` is not 0.

The expression is `false` if otherwise.

*For example, if `i` is 2, then the condition is always true.*

*`<` is higher than `!=` in precedence.*
