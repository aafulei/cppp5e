**Exercise 5.15:** Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you detect.

(a)

```c++
for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix) { /* . . . */ }
if (ix != sz)
   // . . .
```

(b)

```c++
int ix;
for (ix != sz; ++ix) { /* . . . */ }
```

(c) 

```c++
for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix, ++ sz) { /* . . . */ }
```

**Answer:** (a) `ix`, local to `for`, cannot be accessed after the loop.
```c++
int ix = 0;
for (ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix) { /* . . . */ }
if (ix != sz)
	// . . .
```

(b) Wrong syntax. `for` must have

1. a declaration statement, or
2. an expression statement, or
3. a null statement

in the first of the three slots in the header.

```c++
int ix;
for (; ix != sz; ++ix) { /* . . . */ }
```

(c) Infinite loop.

```c++
for (int ix = 0; ix != sz; ++ix) { /* . . . */ }
```

**Exercise 5.16:** The `while` loop is particularly good at executing while some condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file. The `for` loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index steps through a range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of each loop and then rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you could use only one loop, which would you choose? Why?

**Answer:** 

```c++
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using std::string;
using std::vector;

vector<string> text;
string word;
// using while to read words into a vector of strings
while (cin >> word)
	text.push_back(word);
// is the same as
for (string word; cin >> word; text.push_back(word))
    ;
```

```c++
int sum = 0;
// using for to sum from 1 to 10
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i)
	sum += i;
// is the same as
sum = 0;
int i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
	sum += i;
	++i;
}
// alternatively:
i = 1;
while (i <= 10)
	sum += i++;
```

I usually prefer `for` loop, which is more compact.
