**Exercise 7.54:** Should the members of `Debug` that begin with `set_` be declared as `constexpr`? If not, why not?

```c++
void set_io(bool b) { io = b; }
void set_hw(bool b) { hw = b; }
void set_other(bool b) { hw = b; }
```

**Answer:** No. Ultimately, a `constexpr` function is a function which we may use in a constant expression. As `set_` functions return no value, it seems pointless to declare it as `constexpr`. Apart from that, the C++11 restriction on a `constexpr` is quite strict:

1. a `constexpr` function must have *exactly one* `return`, which `set_` functions do not satisfy;
2. a `constexpr` function is implicitly `const` [^C++11], which `set_` functions do not satisfy.

[^C++11]: C++11 stated that all non-static member functions that were declared `constexpr` were also implicitly declared `const`, with respect to `this`. That has since been removed; non-static member functions may be non-`const` in C++14.

**Exercise 7.55:** Is the `Data` class from *ยง 7.5.5 (p. 298)* a literal class? If not, why not? If so, explain why it is literal.

```c++
struct Data {
    int ival;
    string s;
};
```

**Answer:** No. To be a literal class, an aggregate class must have all of its members have literal types, but `s` is a `string`, which is not a literal type.
