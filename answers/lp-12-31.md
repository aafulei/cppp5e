**Exercise 12.31:** What difference(s) would it make if we used a `vector` instead of a `set` to hold the line numbers? Which approach is better? Why?

**Answer:** Using a `set` is better, because

1. a `vector` allows duplicated values, while a `set` holds only unique values
2. checking whether a value is present is much faster in a `set` than in a `vector`
