**Exercise 11.5:** Explain the difference between a `map` and a `set`. When might you use one or the other?

**Answer:** A `map` stores key-value pairs. It fetches the value of an element by its key. A `map` may be used to hold a dictionary, where key is the word, and value is the definition.

A `set` stores only keys. It supports efficient queries as to whether a key is present in the `set`. A `set` may be used to maintain a set of words, such as "the" or "that", which are ignored when we count the words.

**Exercise 11.6:** Explain the difference between a `set` and a `list`. When might you use one or the other?

**Answer:** A `set` is an associative container which stores many keys. It supports efficient queries as to whether a key is present in the `set`. A `set` may be used to store customers who have written bad checks.

 A `list` is a sequential container where elements are stored in relation to their positions. It supports fast insertion/erasure at any place, but random access is not as fast. A `list` may be used to optimize a traveling plan to visit a list of places of interests.
