// Exercise 14.24: Decide whether the class you used in exercise 7.40 from ยง 7.5.1 (p. 291) needs a copy- and move-assignment operator. If so, define those operators.

// Answer: No. Because we haven't defined any copy-control members, and all the (non-static) data members of a Book are strings, which can be moved, the compiler will synthesize copy- and move-assignment operator for us.

// Exercise 14.25: Implement any other assignment operators your class should define. Explain which types should be used as operands and why.

// Answer: We implement Book & opreator=(const string &); which assigns a new ISBN to the book. The type of the right-hand operand is const string & because we do not modify and need not to copy it.
