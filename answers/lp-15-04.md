**Exercise 15.4:** Which of the following declarations, if any, are incorrect? Explain why.

```c++
class Base { ... };
(a) class Derived : public Derived { ... };
(b) class Derived : private Base { ... };
(c) class Derived : public Base;
```

**Answer: ** (a) is incorrect because a class cannot inherit from itself, the reason being that a class has to be defined before being able to serve as a base .
