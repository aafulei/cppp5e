**Exercise 16.9:** What is a function template? What is a class template?

**Answer:** A function template is a blueprint for the compiler to generate functions. The compiler does so according to the template arguments it deduces or we supply. The process is called instantiation. A class template is a blueprint for the compiler to generate classes. Unlike a function template, the compiler cannot deduce template arguments for class templates, which we must provide explicitly.

**Exercise 16.10:** What happens when a class template is instantiated?

**Answer:** By default, a member of an instantiated class is instantiated only if that member is used. However, in explicit instantiation, all the class members will be instantiated when the compiler sees the explicit template definition.

**Exercise 16.11:** The following definition of `List` is incorrect. How would you fix it?

```c++
template <typename elemType> class ListItem;
template <typename elemType> class List {
public:
    List<elemType>();
    List<elemType>(const List<elemType> &);
    List<elemType>& operator=(const List<elemType> &);
    ~List();
    void insert(ListItem *ptr, elemType value);
private:
    ListItem *front, *end;
};
```

**Answer:** Change `ListItem` to `ListItem<elemType>` for all the occurrences in the class template of `List`.
