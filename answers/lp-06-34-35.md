**Exercise 6.34:** What would happen if the stopping condition in factorial were `if (val != 0)`?

```c++
// calculate val!, which is 1 * 2 * 3 . . . * val
int factorial(int val)
{
    if (val > 1)
        return factorial(val-1) * val;
    return 1;
}
```

**Answer:** Disaster for negative `val`. 

**Exercise 6.35:** In the call to `factorial`, why did we pass `val - 1` rather than `val--`?

**Answer:** Value of `val--` is unchanged from original `val`.
