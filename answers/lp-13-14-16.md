**Exercise 13.14:** Assume that `numbered` is a class with a default constructor that generates a unique serial number for each object, which is stored in a data member named `mysn`. Assuming `numbered` uses the synthesized copy-control members and given the following function:

```c++
void f (numbered s) { cout << s.mysn << endl; }
```

what output does the following code produce?

```c++
numbered a, b = a, c = b;
f(a); f(b); f(c);
```

**Answer:** Three identical `mysn` numbers corresponding to `a`.

**Exercise 13.15:** Assume `numbered` has a copy constructor that generates a new serial number. Does that change the output of the calls in the previous exercise? If so, why? What output gets generated?

**Answer:** Yes. Because each time the copy constructor is called, a new serial number is given. The output is three distinct `mysn` numbers corresponding to the parameters of `f()`. They are initialized from the arguments every time `f()` is called.

**Exercise 13.16:** What if the parameter in `f` were `const numbered &`? Does that change the output? If so, why? What output gets generated? 

**Answer:** Yes. Because each time the copy constructor is called, a new serial number is given. The output is different from that of Exercise 13.14 and that of Exercise 13.15 as well. It is three distinct `mysn` numbers corresponding to `a`, `b` and `c`.

Consider

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
static int serial = 0;
class numbered
{
	int mysn;
public:
	numbered() : mysn(++serial) {}
	numbered(const numbered & s) : mysn(++serial) {}       // add for Exercises 13.15 & 13.16
friend
    // void f (numbered s) ... for Exercises 13.14 & 13.15
	void f (const numbered & s) { cout << s.mysn << endl; }// for Exercise 13.16
};

// void f (numbered); for Exercises 13.14 & 13.15
void f (const numbered & s);

int main()
{
	numbered a, b = a, c = b;
	f(a); f(b); f(c);
	return 0;
}
```

The outputs are

| Exercise 13.14 | Exercise 13.15 | Exercise 13.16 |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `1` `1` `1`    | `4` `5` `6`    | `1` `2` `3`    |
