Consider

```c++
template<typename T>
void foo()
{
	typename T::S * p;
}
```

With `typename T::S`, we confirm to the compiler that `S` is a type defined in the `T` scope. In this way, `p` is defined to be a pointer to the type `T::S`. Without `typename`, there would be ambiguity. It could also be that `S` is a static member in class `T`, and it multiplies with `p`.

##### 16.1 Defining a Template

> Design question: Why do you think a member function of a class template is instantiated *only if* the program uses that member function?

This lets us instantiate a class with a type that may not meet the requirements for some of the template's operations.
