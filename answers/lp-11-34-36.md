**Exercise 11.34:** What would happen if we used the subscript operator instead of `find` in the `transform` function?

```c++
const string & transform(const string &s, const map<string, string> &m)
{
	auto map_it = m.find(s);
	if (map_it != m.cend())
		return map_it->second;
	else
		return s;
}
```

**Answer:** The program would try to insert `s` into the `map` if it is not present. However, since `m` is `const`, the compiler would complain.

**Exercise 11.35:** In `buildMap`, what effect, if any, would there be from rewriting

```c++
trans_map[key] = value.substr(1);
```

as

```c++
trans_map.insert({key, value.substr(1)});
```

```c++
map<string, string> buildMap(ifstream &map_file)
{
    map<string, string> trans_map;
    string key;
    string value;
    while (map_file >> key && getline(map_file, value))
        if (value.size() > 1)
            trans_map[key]  = value.substr(1);
        else
            throw runtime_error("no rule for " + key);
    return trans_map;
}
```

**Answer:** If every `key` appears only once in the `map_file`, then the result would be the same. However, if a `key` appear for multiple times, then using a subscript would record the last value, while using `insert()` would record the first value.

**Exercise 11.36:** Our program does no checking on the validity of either input file. In particular, it assumes that the rules in the transformation file are all sensible. What would happen if a line in that file has a key, one space, and then the end of the line? Predict the behavior and then check it against your version of the program.

**Answer:** Since it is verified that `value.size() > 1` before every insertion takes place, that key would be dismissed.
