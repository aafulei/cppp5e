**Exercise 9.25:** In the program on *page 349* that erased a range of elements, what happens if `elem1` and `elem2` are equal? What if `elem2` or both `elem1` and `elem2` are the off-the-end iterator?

```c++
// delete the range of elements between two iterators
// returns an iterator to the element just after the last removed element
elem1 = slist.erase(elem1, elem2); // after the call elem1 == elem2
```

**Answer:** If `elem1 == elem2`, nothing would happen.

If `elem2` is the off-the-end iterator, the elements from `elem1` to the end would be erased.

If both `elem1` and `elem2` are off-the-end iterator, nothing would happen.
