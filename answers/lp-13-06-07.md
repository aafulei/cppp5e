**Exercise 13.6:** What is a copy-assignment operator? When is this operator used? What does the synthesized copy-assignment operator do? When is it synthesized?

**Answer:** For a class type, a copy-assignment operator is an operator of the form `=`, whose left-hand operand is bound to the implicit `this` parameter. It controls how an object of the class is assigned. When the class does not define its own copy-assignment operator, the compiler will synthesize one.

**Exercise 13.7:** What happens when we assign one `StrBlob` to another? What about `StrBlobPtrs`?

```c++
class StrBlob {
public:
    // ...
    StrBlob();
    StrBlob(initializer_list<string> il);
    // ...
private:
    shared_ptr<vector<string>> data;
    // ...
};

class StrBlobPtr {
public:
    StrBlobPtr();
    StrBlobPtr(StrBlob &a, size_t sz = 0);
    // ...
private:
    // ...
    weak_ptr<vector<string>> wptr;
    size_t curr;
};
```

**Answer:** Both rely on the synthesized copy-assignment operator.

- For a `StrBlob`, `data` of the right-hand `StrBlob` will be assigned to the left-hand `StrBlob`. The use count of the shared pointer will be incremented by 1. The left-hand `StrBlob` manages the same `vector<string>` as the right-hand `StrBlob`.
- For a `StrBlobPtr`, `wptr` and `curr` of the right-hand `StrBlob` will be assigned to the left-hand `StrBlob`. The use count of the shared pointer to which the weak pointer `wptr` points will remain unchanged, because making a copy of the weak pointer does not affect the use count of the shared pointer. The left-hand `StrBlobPtr` points to the same `string` as the right-hand `StrBlobPtr`.
