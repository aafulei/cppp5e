**Exercise 5.22:** The last example in this section that jumped back to begin could be better written using a loop. Rewrite the code to eliminate the goto.

```c++
// backward jump over an initialized variable definition is okay
begin:
int sz = get_size();
if (sz <= 0) {
      goto begin;
}
```

**Answer:** 

```c++
int sz;
while ((sz = get_size()) <= 0) ;
```
