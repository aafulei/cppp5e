**Exercise 3.38:** In this section, we noted that it was not only illegal but meaningless to try to add two pointers. Why would adding two pointers be meaningless?

**Answer:** Pointers correspond to addresses in the physical memory. Consider addresses on a street. Say Paul lives in No. 3, while James lives in No. 23. Subtracting No. 3 from No. 23 you have the idea of how far away they live. You go up by 20 numbers from Paul's and you should arrive at James'. What's the point of add No. 3 to No. 23 ?
