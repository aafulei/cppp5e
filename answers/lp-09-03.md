**Exercise 9.3:** What are the constraints on the iterators that form iterator ranges?

**Answer:** For the pair of iterators in [`begin` , `end` ) to represent a valid range,

1. `begin` and `end` must refer to the elements or the one past the last element in the *same* container
3. `end` shall not precede `begin` so that it is possible to reach `end` by repeated incrementing `begin`
