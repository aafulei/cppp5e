#### Chapter 11 Associative Containers

- *sequential containers*: elements are stored and accessed sequentially by their position.
- *associative containers*: elements are stored and retrieved by a key.

A `map` is also known as an *associative array*.

> What are the three dimensions by which we differentiates the eight associative containers?

1. key-value pair or just key
2. require unique keys or allow multiple keys (for a map, that's *injective* in mathematical terms)
3. ordered or unordered

> Where is `multimap` defined?

`<map>`

> Where is `unordered_set` defined?

`<unordered_set>`

#####11.1 Using an Associative Container 

> What is the element type of a `map<K,V>`?

`std::pair<K, V>`

> Let `word` be a `string`, and `exclude` be a `set<string>`, what's the purpose of
>
> ```c++
> if (exclude.find(word) == exclude.end()) // ...
> ```

Execute the conditional statement if `word` is not found in `exclude`.

##### 11.2 Overview of the Associative Containers

> Does an associative container support `insert()`?

Yes.

> What category does an iterator to an associative container belong to?

Bidirectional.

> What is a strict weak ordering?

A strict weak ordering `<` is a relation defined to compare two keys/elements, which satisfies the following properties: (we define `>=` as the negation of `<`)

1. $k_1 < k_2 \implies k_1 \geq k_2$
2. $k_1 < k_2, \ k_2 < k_3 \implies k_1 < k_3$
3. If $k_1 \geq k_2, \ k_2 \geq k_1$ , we define $k_1 = k_2$
   1. $k_1 = k_2, \ k_2 = k_3 \implies k_1 = k_3$

> Define a `set` of integers whose order is determined by the remainder after division by 7.

```c++
bool comp7(int a, int b)
{ return a % 7 < b % 7; }
set<int, bool(*)(int, int)> z(comp7);
```

> Where is `std::pair` defined?

`<utility>`

> Consider
>
> ```c++
> pair<int, int> p0, p1(1, -2), p2(-1, 2);
> ```
>
> What is the relationship among `p0`, `p1` and `p2`?

$p_2 < p_0 < p_1$

1. elements of a pair is value initialized
2. first compare the member first, then the second member

```c++
point add(point a, point b)
{	
    return {a.first + b.first, a.second + b.second};
}
```

>
> Call it to add points $(-1, 2)$ and $(3.0, 4.5)$.

```c++
point result = add({-1, 2}, {3, 4.5});
```

##### 11.3 Operations on Associative Containers

> What is the type for `map<int, string>::mapped_type`?

`string`

> What is the type for `map<int, string>::value_type`?

`pair<const int, string>`

> What's the problem with
>
> ```c++
> set<int> s = {1,2,3,4,5};
> transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), [](int a){ return a * 2; });
> ```

The keys in a `set` are read-only.

> Do you agree with the following statement? Why?
>
> "For a `set`, there isn't much difference between an `iterator` and a `const_iterator`."

Yes. The keys in a `set` are read-only.

> Given `c` is a `set<string>`, What does `c.insert()` return?

A `pair<set<string>::iterator, bool>`. The first element is an iterator to the element with the given key. The second element indicates if the element was inserted.

> Use a `map<string, size_t>` and `insert` to write a program to count words.

```c++
map<string, size_t> count;
for (string word; cin >> word; ) {
    auto result = count.insert({word, 1});
    if (!result.second)
        ++res.first->second;
}
```

>
> ```c++
> multimap<int, string> m;
> m.insert({23, "Jordan"});
> m.insert({23, "Jordan"});
> cout << m.size() << " ";
> cout << m.erase(23) << endl;
> ```

`2 2`

> Let `c` be an `multiset<string>`. What could be type of `x` as in `c.erase(x)`?

1. `string`
2. `multiset<string>::iterator`

> Let `mm` be a `multimap<string, string>` that maps IT companies to their products. Use `mm.find()` to print out all the products of `"Microsoft"`.

```c++
extern multimap<string, string> mm;
string ms = "Microsoft";
auto count = mm.count(ms)
for (auto it = mm.find(ms); count != 0; ++it, --count)
    cout << it->second << endl;
// alternatively:
// for (auto p = make_pair(mm.find(ms), mm.count(ms)); p.second != 0; ++p.first, --p.second)
//    cout << p.first->second << endl;
```

> Let `mm` be a `multimap<string, string>` that maps IT companies to their products. Use `mm.lower_bound()` and `mm.upper_bound` to print out all the products of `"Apple"`.

```c++
extern multimap<string, string> mm;
string ap = "Apple";
for (auto it = mm.lower_bound(ap); it != mm.upper_bound; ++it)
    cout << it->second << endl;
```

> Let `mm` be a `multimap<string, string>` that maps IT companies to their products. Use `mm.equal_range()` to print out all the products of `"Google"`.

```c++
extern multimap<string, string> mm;
string gg = "Google";
for (auto p = mm.equal_range(gg); p.first != p.second; ++p.first)
    cout << p.first->second << endl;
```

> What is the output of
>
> ```c++
> multimap<int, string> mm;
> mm.insert({0, "z"});
> mm.insert({0, "a"});
> for (auto e : mm)
>     cout << e.second << " ";
> ```

`z a`

##### 11.4 The Unordered Containers

> When should we use an unordered associative container?

1. when the key type does not have an obvious ordering relationship;
2. when the cost of maintaining the elements in order is prohibitive.

> What is a bucket as in an unordered associative container?

An unordered associative container uses a hash function to help store elements. A hash function maps elements to buckets. All the elements that have the same hash value go to the same bucket. Ideally, a good hash function should map each element to a unique bucket. But it could be the case that one bucket has multiple elements. To access an element, the container first computes its hash value, which tells the container which bucket to search. When a bucket holds several elements, those elements are searched sequentially.

> Let `c` be an unordered associative container. Explain:
>
> 1. `c.load_factor()`
> 2. `c.max_load_factor()`
> 3. `c.rehash(n)`
> 4. `c.reserve(n)`

1. `c.load_factor()` returns a `float` indicating the average number of elements in one bucket
2. `c.max_load_factor()` returns a `float` indicating the max number of elements in one bucket. This is the bucket size that `c` tries to maintain. That is, `c` adds buckets to keep `c.load_factor()`  `<=` `c.max_load_factor()`.
3. `c.rehash(n)` reorganizes the storage so that:
   1. `c.bucket_count` `>=` `n`
   2. `c.bucket_count` `>=` `c.size()/c.max_load_factor()`
4. `c.reserve(n)` reorganizes the storage so that `c` may hold `n` elements without a rehash

> What types can we store in an unordered associative container without supplying our own version of comparison and hash function?

Library built-in types, including pointers, and `string` and smart pointers.

> Consider
>
> ```c++
> size_t hasher(const Sales_data & sd){ return hash<string>()(sd.isbn()); }
> ```
>
> Why are there two pairs of parentheses following `hash<string>`?

`hash<string>()`  is a default initialized temporary object of class type `hash<string>`. This type has its `()` operator overloaded. That is, the temporary object is a function object, which takes a `string` (`sd.isbn()`) as its argument, and returns a `size_t`, which is the hash value for the given `string`.
