**Exercise 3.3:** Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input operator and in the `getline` function.

**Answer:**

leading whitespaces are ignored; reads characters before the first space, tab or newline into string `s`

- `getline` function: `getline(is, s)`

reads characters before the first newline into string `s`
