**Exercise 12.17:** Which of the following `unique_ptr` declarations are illegal or likely to result in subsequent program error? Explain what the problem is with each one.

```c++
int ix = 1024, *pi = &ix, *pi2 = new int(2048);
typedef unique_ptr<int> IntP;
```

**Answer:** 

(a) `IntP p0(ix);` Illegal, because `unique_ptr` is not initialized from a pointer.

(b) `IntP p1(pi);` Illegal, because `unique_ptr` is not initialized from a dynamically allocated pointer.

(c) `IntP p2(pi2);` Legal but likely to result in subsequent program errors

1. when `p2` goes out of scope, `pi2` will be invalidated
2. the other way round, if `pi2` is deleted first, then `p2` will be invalidated

(d) `IntP p3(&ix);` Illegal, because `unique_ptr` is not initialized from a dynamically allocated pointer.

(e) `IntP p4(new int(2048));` Legal.

(f) `IntP p5(p2.get());` Legal but likely to result in subsequent program errors -- when `p5` goes out of scope, `p2` will be invalidated.

**Exercise 12.18:** Why doesnâ€™t `shared_ptr` have a `release` member?

**Answer:** The ownership is shared rather than exclusive for a `shared_ptr`. Thus there is no need to transfer ownership from one shared pointer to another using `release`.
