**Exercise 9.39:** Explain what the following program fragment does:

```c++
vector<string> svec;
svec.reserve(1024);
string word;
while (cin >> word)
	svec.push_back(word);
svec.resize(svec.size()+svec.size()/2);
```

**Answer:** 

1. `svec` allocates space to hold *at least* 1024 strings
2. strings from the standard input are appended to `svec` -- if more strings than the capacity are read, the capacity will grow automatically to accommodate to it
3. `svec` resizes to 1.5 times the current size -- if the new size becomes larger than the capacity, the capacity will grow automatically to accommodate to it

**Exercise 9.40:** If the program in the previous exercise reads 256 words, what is its likely capacity after it is resized? What if it reads 512? 1,000? 1,048?

**Answer:**

- If the previous exercise reads 256 words, the capacity after resizing is likely to be 1,024.
- If the previous exercise reads 512 words, the capacity after resizing is likely to be 1,024.
- If the previous exercise reads 1,000 words, the capacity after resizing is likely to be 2,048.
- If the previous exercise reads 1,048 words, the capacity after resizing is likely to be 2,048.
