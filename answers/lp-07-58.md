**Exercise 7.58:** Which, if any, of the following `static` data member declarations and definitions are errors? Explain why.

```c++
// example.h
class Example {
public:
	static double rate = 6.5;
	static const int vecSize = 20;
	static vector<double> vec(vecSize);
};
// example.C
#include "example.h"
double Example::rate;
vector<double> Example::vec;
```

**Answer:** `static double rate = 6.5;` and `static vector<double> vec(vecSize);` are wrong. Cannot provide in-class initializers to non-const data members.
