This folder stores my solutions to 600+ exercises in first 16 of 19 chapters in **C++ Primer (5th Edition)**. Most of them are done in the spring of 2018.

Questions and answers are done in `.md` format.

Most programming exercises are standalone `.cpp` files.

A few large programming exercises rely on the `.h` files that I wrote and put in the `include` folder.

The naming is self-explanatory.

For example, `lp-04-04-07.md` has the answers to *Exercise 4.4* to *Exercise 4.7*.

As another example, `lp-16-53-55.cpp` has the programming solutions to *Exercise 16.53* to *Exercise 16.55*. (In case you are curious: `lp` stands for Lippman, major author of the book.)

Specifically, `lp-xx-00.md` contains the C++ concept checkers that I wrote for myself for chapter `xx`.

All the `.cpp` files are ready to compile, with a g++ compiler on MinGW on Windows 10. C++11 support is required.
