**Exercise 15.31:** Given that `s1`, `s2`, `s3`, and `s4` are all `string`s, determine what objects are created in the following expressions:

```c++
(a) Query(s1) | Query(s2) & ~ Query(s3); 
(b) Query(s1) | (Query(s2) & ~ Query(s3)); 
(c) (Query(s1) & (Query(s2)) | (Query(s3) & Query(s4)));
```

**Answer:** 

(a) `WordQuery`, `NotQuery`, `AndQuery`, `OrQuery`

(b) the same as (a)

(c) `WordQuery`,  `AndQuery`, `OrQuery`

**Exercise 15.32:** What happens when an object of type `Query` is copied, moved, assigned, and destroyed?

**Answer:** `Query` has only one data member, which is a shared pointer. Thus what happens when a `Query` is copied, moved, assigned and destroyed is determined by the effect of these operations on that shared pointer.

**Exercise 15.33:** What about objects of type `Query_base`?

**Answer:** `Query_base` is an abstract class that has no data members. It contains design but no data for its derived classes.

**Exercise 15.34:** For the expression built in Figure 15.3 (*p. 638*):

```c++
Query q = Query("fiery") & Query("bird") | Query("wind");
```

(a) List the constructors executed in processing that expression.

(b) List the calls to rep that are made from `cout << q`.

(c) List the calls to `eval` made from `q.eval()`.

**Answer:** 

(a)

```c++
WordQuery::WordQuery(const string &);
BinaryQuery::BinaryQuery(const Query &, const Query &, string);
AndQuery::AndQuery(const Query &, const Query &);
OrQuery::OrQuery(const Query &, const Query &);
```

(b)
