**Exercise 6.13:** Assuming `T` is the name of a type, explain the difference between a function declared as `void f(T)` and `void f(T&)`.

**Answer:** Pass by value versus pass by reference.

**Exercise 6.14:** Give an example of when a parameter should be a reference type. Give an example of when a parameter should not be a reference.

**Answer:** To use a reference type: change all the letters in a string to uppercase. For example,

```c++
void uppper(string &s)
{
	for (auto & c : s)
		c = toupper(c);
}
```

Not to use a reference type: when passing a pointer, we may take the address directly, and there is no need to use a reference. For example,

```c++
void print(int * p, int n)
{
	while (n-- > 0)
		cout << *p++ << " "; 
}

int main()
{
    int a[] = {1, 2, 3};
	print(a, sizeof a / sizeof a[0]);
	return 0;
}
```

**Exercise 6.15:** Explain the rationale for the type of each of `find_char`â€™s parameters In particular, why is `s` a reference to const but `occurs` is a plain reference? Why are these parameters references, but the char parameter `c` is not? What would happen if we made `s` a plain reference? What if we made `occurs` a reference to const?

```c++
string::size_type find_char(const string &s, char c,
                           string::size_type &occurs)
{
    auto ret = s.size();   // position of the first occurrence, if any
    occurs = 0;            // set the occurrence count parameter
    for (decltype(ret) i = 0; i != s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == c) {
            if (ret == s.size())
                ret = i;   // remember the first occurrence of c
            ++occurs;      // increment the occurrence count
         }
    }
    return ret;            // count is returned implicitly in occurs
}
```

**Answer:** `const` for `s` because we do not plan to change it. However, we are to make change to `occurs` which is used as a counter. `c` is temporary and is a `char`, which is easy to pass by value. If we made `s` a plain reference, we may make changes to it. If we made `occurs` a reference-to-const, then there would be a compilation error since we are not allowed to change it.
