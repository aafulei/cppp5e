**Exercise 13.20:** Explain what happens when we copy, assign, or destroy objects of our `TextQuery` and `QueryResult` classes from ยง 12.3 (p. 484).

```c++
class TextQuery {
    // ...
private:
    shared_ptr<svectorstring>>  file;
    map<string, shared_ptr<set<line_no>>> wm;
};
class QueryResult {
    // ...
private:
    string sought;
    shared_ptr<set<line_no>> lines;
    shared_ptr<vector<string>> file;
};
```

**Answer:** Since the two classes do not define their own versions of copy-control members, the compiler will synthesize them, which will copy, assign and destroy memberwise.

**Exercise 13.21:** Do you think the `TextQuery` and `QueryResult` classes need to define their own versions of the copy-control members? If so, why? If not, why not? Implement whichever copy-control operations you think these classes require.

**Answer:** No. By using smart pointers, memberwise copy, assignment and destruction will meet all the requirements.
