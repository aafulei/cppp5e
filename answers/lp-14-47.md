**Exercise 14.47:** Explain the difference between these two conversion operators:

```c++
struct Integral {
    operator const int();
    operator int() const;
};
```

**Answer:** The first converts an `Integral` to a `const int` which may change the state of the object. The second converts an `Integral` to an `int` which cannot change the state of the object.
