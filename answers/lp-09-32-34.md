**Exercise 9.32:** In the program on *page 354* would it be legal to write the call to `insert` as follows? If not, why not?

```c++
iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter++);
```

```c++
// silly loop to remove even-valued elements and insert a duplicate of odd-valued elements
vector<int> vi = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
auto iter = vi.begin(); // call begin, not cbegin because we're changing vi
while (iter != vi.end()) {
	if (*iter % 2) {
		iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter); // duplicate the current element
		iter += 2; // advance past this element and the one inserted before it
	}
	else
		iter = vi.erase(iter); // remove even elements
		// don't advance the iterator; iter denotes the element after the one we erased
}
```

**Answer:** No, because the order of arguments' evaluation is unspecified in C++. We do not know whether `iter` or `*iter++` would be evaluated first, which would lead to different results.

**Exercise 9.33:** In the final example in this section what would happen if we did not assign the result of `insert` to `begin`? Write a program that omits this assignment to see if your expectation was correct.

```c++
// safer: recalculate end on each trip whenever the loop adds/erases elements
while (begin != v.end()) {
    // do some processing
    ++begin;  // advance begin because we want to insert after this element
    begin = v.insert(begin, 42);  // insert the new value
    ++begin;  // advance begin past the element we just added
}
```

**Answer:** Undefined behavior as the iterator may get invalidated after insertion. My program crashes.

**Exercise 9.34:** Assuming `vi` is a container of `int`s that includes even and odd values, predict the behavior of the following loop. After youâ€™ve analyzed this loop, write a program to test whether your expectations were correct.

```c++
iter = vi.begin();
while (iter != vi.end()) {
    if (*iter % 2)
        iter = vi.insert(iter, *iter);
    ++iter;
}
```

*A pair of `{}` is missing from the original code.*

**Answer:** The computer will run out of memory, because whenever an odd value appears, the program will repeatedly insert that value before it, pushing the size of the vector over its limit.
