// Exercise 5.21: Revise the program from the exercise in ยง 5.5.1 (p. 191) so that it looks only for duplicated words that start with an uppercase letter.

// Exercise 5.20: Write a program to read a sequence of strings from the standard input until either the same word occurs twice in succession or all the words have been read. Use a while loop to read the text one word at a time. Use the break statement to terminate the loop if a word occurs twice in succession. Print the word if it occurs twice in succession, or else print a message saying that no word was repeated.
