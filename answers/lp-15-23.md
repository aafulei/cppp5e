**Exercise 15.23:** Assuming class `D1` on *page 620* had intended to override its inherited `fcn` function, how would you fix that class? Assuming you fixed the class so that `fcn` matched the definition in `Base`, how would the calls in that section be resolved?

```c++
class Base {
public:
    virtual int fcn();
};
class D1 : public Base {
public:
    int fcn(int);		// change to "virtual int fcn() override;" to override
    virtual void f2();
};
class D2 : public D1 {
public:
    int fcn(int);
    int fcn();
    void f2();
};
```

**Answer:** Change the call signature of `fcn()` in `D1` to

```c++
virtual int fcn() override;	// virtual and override are not mandatory
```

For a plain object, the function called corresponds to its static type.

For a pointer or a reference to a `Base` object, the function called corresponds to its dynamic type.

```c++
Base bobj;  D1 d1obj; D2 d2obj;
Base *bp1 = &bobj, *bp2 = &d1obj, *bp3 = &d2obj;
bp1->fcn(); // virtual call, will call Base::fcn at run time
bp2->fcn(); // virtual call, will call D1::fcn at run time				// different
bp3->fcn(); // virtual call, will call D2::fcn at run time
D1 *d1p = &d1obj; D2 *d2p = &d2obj;
bp2->f2(); // error: Base has no member named f2
d1p->f2(); // virtual call, will call D1::f2() at run time
d2p->f2(); // virtual call, will call D2::f2() at run time
Base *p1 = &d2obj; D1 *p2 = &d2obj; D2 *p3 =  &d2obj;
p1->fcn(42);  // error: Base has no version of fcn that takes an int
p2->fcn(42);  // error: D1 has no version of fcn that takes an int		// different
p3->fcn(42);  // statically bound, calls D2::fcn(int)
```
