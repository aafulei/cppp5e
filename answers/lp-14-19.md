**Exercise 14.19:** Should the class you chose for exercise 7.40 from *ยง 7.5.1 (p. 291)* define the relational operators? If so, implement them. If not, explain why not.

```c++
class Book
{
	string isbn;
	string title;
	string author;
    // ...
};
```

**Answer:** No, because it is pointless to say one book is *less than* or *greater than* another book.
