**Exercise 9.1:** Which is the most appropriate—a `vector`, a `deque`, or a `list`—for the following program tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice. If there is no reason to prefer one or another container, explain why not.

(a) Read a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container alphabetically as they are entered. We’ll see in the next chapter that associative containers are better suited to this problem.

(b) Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the back. Remove the next value from the front.

(c) Read an unknown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and then print them to standard output.

**Answer: **

(a) use a `list`, because inserting/erasing operations are expected in the middle of the container. [^analysis]

(b) use a `deque`, which is fast at inserting/erasing at both ends of the container.

(c) use a `vector`, since there is no need to insert/erase in the middle of the container.

[^analysis]: algorithmic analysis is required to compare: (1) using a `vector` and then `sort`, with (2) using a `list`
