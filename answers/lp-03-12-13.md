**Exercise 3.12:** Which, if any, of the following `vector` definitions are in error ? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.

(a) `vector<vector<int>> ivec;`
(b) `vector<string> svec = ivec;`
(c) `vector<string> svec(10, "null");`

**Answer:**

(a) Legal. Creates an empty vector of `int` vector;
(b) Illegal. Type mismatch;
(c) Legal. Creates a `vector` of 10 `string`s, each of which is "null".

**Exercise  3.13:**  How  many  elements  are  there  in  each  of  the following `vector`s? What are the values of the elements?

(a) `vector<int> v1;`

(b) `vector<int> v2(10);`

(c) `vector<int> v3(10, 42);`

(d) `vector<int> v4{10};`

(e) `vector<int> v5{10, 42};`

(f) `vector<string> v6{10};`

(g) `vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};`

**Answer:**

(a) 0.

(b) 10. *Note: NOT 1! This is value initialization by supplying only a size.*

(c) 10.

(d) 1.

(e) 2. *Note: For curly braces, try list initialization first.*

(f) 10. *Note: For curly braces, if list initialization is not possible, try other ways.*

(g) 10.
