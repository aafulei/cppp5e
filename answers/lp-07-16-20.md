**Exercise 7.16:** What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an access specifier may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members should be defined after a public specifier? What kinds should be private?

**Answer:** Let the interface be `public` and the implementation be `private`. For example, constructors ordinarily should be `public`.

**Exercise 7.17:** What, if any, are the differences between using `class` or `struct`?

**Answer:** Default access specifier is `private` for `class` , `public` for `struct`.

**Exercise 7.18:** What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?

**Answer:** Hiding implementation by specifying access control, so that users have access to the interface but have no access to the implementation.

**Exercise 7.19:** Indicate which members of your `Person` class you would declare as `public` and which you would declare as `private`. Explain your choice.

**Answer:**  Declare the constructors and getter functions as `public` as they are the interface, whereas declare the data members as `private` as they belong to the implementation.

```c++
class Person
{
	string name;
	string addr;
public:
	Person(const string & n) : name(n) {}
	Person(const string & n, const string & a) : name(n), addr(a) {}
	string get_name() const { return name; }
	string get_addr() const { return addr; }
};
```

**Exercise 7.20:** When are friends useful? Discuss the pros and cons of using friends.

**Answer:** 

| pros                                                         | cons                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| granting access to special classes/functions so that they may visit the areas that are not open to the general public | having to make sure the friends you invited do not mess up your house |
| useful functions may refer to class members without prefixing them with the class name | reduce encapsulation and thus maintainability, cause code verbosity |
