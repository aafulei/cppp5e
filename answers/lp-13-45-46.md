**Exercise 13.45:** Distinguish between an rvalue reference and an lvalue reference.

**Answer:**

- lvalue reference: regular reference that is bound to an lvalue (an object's identity)
- rvalue reference: reference that must be bound to an rvalue (an object that is about to be destroyed)

**Exercise 13.46:** Which kind of reference can be bound to the following initializers?

```c++
int f();
vector<int> vi(100);
int ? r1 = f();
int ? r2 = vi[0];
int ? r3 = r1;
int ? r4 = vi[0] * f();
```

**Answer:** 

```c++
int f();
vector<int> vi(100);
int && r1 = f();
int & r2 = vi[0];
int & r3 = r1;				// we can bind an lvalue reference to an rvalue reference
int && r4 = vi[0] * f();
```
