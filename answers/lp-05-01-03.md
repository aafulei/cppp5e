**Exercise 5.1:** What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?

**Answer:** An empty statement `;`. Equivalently, an empty block, `{}`. When the program requires a statement but the logic does not.

**Exercise 5.2:** What is a block? When might you might use a block?

**Answer:** A sequence of zero or more statement enclosed by a pair of curly braces. When the program requires a statement but the logic needs more than one.

**Exercise 5.3:** Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, *p. 157*) to rewrite the while loop from ยง 1.4.1 (*p. 11*) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code.

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    int sum = 0, val  = 1;
    // keep executing the while as long as val is less than or equal to 10
    while (val <= 10)  {
        sum += val;   // assigns sum + val to sum
        ++val;        // add 1 to val
    }
    std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is "
              << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Answer:** 

```c++
while (val <= 10)
	sum += val, ++val;
```

 It diminishes the readability for it violates the principle that one statement is dedicated to one purpose.
