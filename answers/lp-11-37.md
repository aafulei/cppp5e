**Exercise 11.37:** What are the advantages of an unordered container as compared to the ordered version of that container? What are the advantages of the ordered version?

**Answer:** Unordered containers is preferred when:

1. the key type does not have an obvious ordering relationship, or
2. the cost of maintaining the keys in order is prohibitive

However, to achieve good performance on an unordered container, testing and tweaking is often needed.
