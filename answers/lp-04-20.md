Exercise 4.20: Assuming that `iter` is a `vector<string>::iterator`, indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.

(a) `*iter++;`

(b) `(*iter)++;`

(c) `*iter.empty()`

(d) `iter->empty();`

(e) `++*iter;`

(f) `iter++->empty();`

**Answer:** (a), (d), (f) are legal.

(a) in effect, return `iter` dereferenced, and then increment `iter` by 1;

(b) illegal because `++` is not defined for a `string`;

(c) illegal because iterator `iter` has no member;

(d) return if `iter` points to an empty `string`;

(e) illegal because `++` is not defined for a `string`;

(f) in effect, return if `iter` points to an empty `string`, and then increment `iter` by 1.
