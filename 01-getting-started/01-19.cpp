// Exercise 1.19: Revise the program you wrote for the exercises in ยง 1.4.1 (p.
// 13) that printed a range of numbers so that it handles input in which the
// first number is smaller than the second.

// Exercise 1.11: Write a program that prompts the user for two integers. Print
// each number in the range specified by those two integers.

// Note: The case where the first number is smaller than the second has already
// been dealt with in Exercise 1.11. Here we deal with the other way around as
// well.
