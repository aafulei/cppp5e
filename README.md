**Organization**

- One folder for each chapter, *e.g.* [01-getting-started](01-getting-started)
    - If an exercise has code associated with it, the code is linked in the `README.md` in the folder.
        - To compile the code, use the `makefile` in the folder. Executables will go to the [binary](binary) folder.
    - If an exercise has no code associated, its solution is provided directly in the `README.md`.
- [binary](binary): executable files
- [data](data): data files that can be used as input using file redirection
- [include](include): header files
- [output](output): output files
- [source](source): standalone source files for large programs, *e.g.* the book store program

- [answers](answers): solutions to chapters 1 to 16 in old format, to be re-organized
