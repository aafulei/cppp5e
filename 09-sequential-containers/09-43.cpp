// Exercise 9.43: Write a function that takes three strings, s, oldVal, and
// newVal. Using iterators, and the insert and erase functions replace all
// instances of oldVal that appear in s by newVal. Test your function by using
// it to replace common abbreviations, such as "tho" by "though" and "thru" by
// "through".
