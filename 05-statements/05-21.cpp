// Exercise 5.21: Revise the program from the exercise in ยง 5.5.1 (p. 191) so
// that it looks only for duplicated words that start with an uppercase letter.

// Exercise 5.20: Write a program to read a sequence of strings from the
// standard input until either the same word occurs twice in succession or all
// the words have been read. Use a while loop to read the text one word at a
// time. Use the break statement to terminate the loop if a word occurs twice in
// succession. Print the word if it occurs twice in succession, or else print a
// message saying that no word was repeated.
