// Exercise 13.22: Assume that we want HasPtr to behave like a value. That is,
// each object should have its own copy of the string to which the objects
// point. We'll show the definitions of the copy-control members in the next
// section. However, you already know everything you need to know to implement
// these members. Write the HasPtr copy constructor and copy-assignment operator
// before reading on.
