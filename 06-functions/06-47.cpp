// Exercise 6.47: Revise the program you wrote in the exercises in ยง 6.3.2 (p. 228) that used recursion to print the contents of a vector to conditionally print information about its execution. For example, you might print the size of the vector on each call. Compile and run the program with debugging turned on and again with it turned off.

// Exercise 6.33: Write a recursive function to print the contents of a vector.

// To turn on debug information, compile as usual.
// To turn it off: g++ lp-06-47.cpp -D NDEBUG
