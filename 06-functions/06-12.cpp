// Exercise 6.12: Rewrite the program from exercise 6.10 in ยง 6.2.1 (p. 210) to
// use references instead of pointers to swap the value of two ints. Which
// version do you think would be easier to use and why?

// Exercise 6.10: Using pointers, write a function to swap the values of two
// ints. Test the function by calling it and printing the swapped values.

// Answer: Using a reference is easier, becasue
// 1.	it is less error-prone;
// 2.	it avoids copying, which, in some cases, might be expensive or impossible.
