**Exercise 16.46:** Explain this loop from `s` in ยง 13.5 (p. 530):

```c++
for (size_t i = 0; i != size(); ++i)
    alloc.construct(dest++, std::move(*elem++));
```

**Answer:** Reallocate the elements from the current storage to the new storage allocated by `alloc`. The elements are moved rather than copied to the new storage.
