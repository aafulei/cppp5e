**Exercise 9.29:** Given that `vec` holds 25 elements, what does `vec.resize(100)` do? What if we next wrote `vec.resize(10)`?

**Answer:** `vec.resize(100)` allocates space for 100 elements --- 75 elements which are value initialized are appended to `vec`. If we next wrote `vec.resize(10)` , `vec` would be a `vector` of the first 10 elements -- the rest 90 elements are erased from the back.

**Exercise 9.30:** What, if any, restrictions does using the version of `resize` that takes a single argument place on the element type?

**Answer:** If the element type is class type, it must support default initialization, because added elements are to be value initialized. In other words, the class does not require an explicit initializer.
