**Exercise 4.13:** What are the values of `i` and `d` after each assignment?

`int i; double d;`

(a) `d = i = 3.5;`

(b) `i = d = 3.5;`

**Answer:**

(a) 3, 3.0

(b) 3, 3.5

**Exercise 4.14:** Explain what happens in each of the if tests:

`if (42 = i)  // ...`
`if (i = 42)  // ...`

**Answer:**

1. Compilation error: Cannot assign to rvalue.
2. `42` is assigned to `i`. The condition is `true`.

**Exercise 4.15:** The following assignment is illegal. Why? How would you correct it?

```c++
double dval; int ival; int *pi;
dval = ival = pi = 0;
```

**Answer:** Impossible to convert `int *` to `int`.

```c++
double dval; int ival; int *pi;
dval = ival = 0;
pi = 0;
```

**Exercise 4.16:** Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.

(a) `if (p = getPtr() != 0)`

(b) `if (i = 1024)`

**Answer:** Because assignment operator is low in precedence and is not equality operator [^*].

(a) `if ((p = getPtr()) != 0)`

(b) `if (i == 1024)`

[^*]: Unless in BASIC. Excuse my French.
