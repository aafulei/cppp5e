**Exercise 1.14:** Compare and contrast the loops that used a `for` with those using a `while`. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

**Answer:** 

- `while`: the most primitive form; tests the condition before doing anything;
- `for`:   a second form designed for certain frequent patterns; defines a control variable local to the loop; separates the increment for clarity; more frequently used when the number of iterations is known in advance, and the increment following an iteration is simple.

**Exercise 1.15:** Write programs that contain the common errors discussed in the  box  on  *page  16*.  Familiarize  yourself  with  the  messages  the  compiler generates.

**Answer:** Syntax errors. Type errors. Declaration errors.
