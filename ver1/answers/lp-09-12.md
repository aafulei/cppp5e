**Exercise 9.12:** Explain the differences between the constructor that takes a container to copy and the constructor that takes two iterators.

**Answer:**

- *initialize with a container* -- both the container types and the element types must be identical;
- *initialize with a pair of iterators* -- the container types need *not* be identical, and the element types can be different, too, so long as conversion is possible.
