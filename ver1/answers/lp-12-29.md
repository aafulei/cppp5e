**Exercise 12.29:** We could have written the loop to manage the interaction with the user as a `do while` (ยง 5.4.4, p. 189) loop. Rewrite the loop to use a `do while`. Explain which version you prefer and why.

```c++
while (true) {
	cout << "enter word to look for, or q to quit: ";
	string s;
	if (!(cin >> s) || s == "q")
		break;
	print(cout, tq.query(s)) << endl;
}
```

**Answer:**

```c++
do {
	cout << "enter word to look for, or q to quit: ";
	string s;
	if (!(cin >> s) || s == "q")
		break;
	print(cout, tq.query(s)) << endl;
}
while (true);
```

Neither, because `while(true)` hardly tells anything about the control of the loop. I prefer to write

```c++
string prompt = "enter word to look for, or q to quit: ";
cout << prompt;
for (string s; cin >> s && s != "q"; cout << prompt)
    print(cout, tq.query(s)) << endl;
```
