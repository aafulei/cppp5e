**Exercise 15.24:** What kinds of classes need a virtual destructor? What operations must a virtual destructor perform?

**Answer:** Any class that may serve as a base class needs a virtual destructor. It doesn't have to do anything more than what is expected for an ordinary destructor. However, being virtual it allows redefinition (override) in the derived classes.

**Exercise 15.25:** Why did we define a default constructor for `Disc_quote`? What effect, if any, would removing that constructor have on the behavior of `Bulk_quote`?

**Answer:** Since we have defined a constructor for `Disc_quote`, the compiler wouldn't synthesize a default constructor for it. The consequence is that any class derived from `Disc_quote` cannot have the corresponding part default constructed, thus cannot have a default constructor. To allow default constructors in derived classes, we have to explicitly define a default constructor for `Disc_quote`.

If the default constructor for `Disc_quote` is removed, then `Bulk_quote`, which is derived from `Disc_quote`, cannot have a default constructor.
