**Exercise 9.21:** Explain how the loop from *page 345* that used the return from `insert` to add elements to a `list` would work if we inserted into a `vector` instead.

```c++
list<string> lst;
auto iter = lst.begin();
while (cin >> word)
	iter = lst.insert(iter, word); // same as calling push_front
```

**Answer:** Consider

```c++
vector<string> vec;
auto iter = vec.begin();
while (cin >> word)
     iter = vec.insert(iter, word);
```

Exactly the same effect but may take more time.
