**Exercise 7.30:** It is legal but redundant to refer to members through the `this` pointer. Discuss the pros and cons of explicitly using the this pointer to access members.

**Answer:**

pros:

- being explicit


- member function may have a parameter which has the same name as the data member, for example

```c++
class C
{
    char c;
public:
    void get() const
    {  	return c; }
    void set(char c)
    {	this->c = c; }
};
```

cons:

- redundant
