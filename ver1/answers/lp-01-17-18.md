**Exercise 1.17:** What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?

**Exercise 1.18:** Compile and run the program from this section giving it only equal values as input. Run it again giving it values in which no number is repeated.

```c++
int main()
{
    // currVal is the number we're counting; we'll read new values into val
    int currVal = 0, val = 0;
    // read first number and ensure that we have data to process
    if (std::cin >> currVal) {
        int cnt = 1;  // store the count for the current value we're processing
        while (std::cin >> val) { // read the remaining numbers
            if (val == currVal)   // if the values are the same
                ++cnt;            // add 1 to cnt
            else { // otherwise, print the count for the previous value
                std::cout << currVal << " occurs "
                          << cnt << " times" << std::endl;
                currVal = val;    // remember the new value
                cnt = 1;          // reset the counter
            }
        }  // while loop ends here
        // remember to print the count for the last value in the file
        std::cout << currVal <<  " occurs "
                  << cnt << " times" << std::endl;
    } // outermost if statement ends here
    return 0;
}
```

**Answer:** Simple answer is that output will be just as expected.

Say if we input `42 42 42 42 `, the output would be `42 occurs 4 times.` 

If we input `42 43 44 45`, the output would be 

```
42 occurs 1 times.
43 occurs 1 times.
44 occurs 1 times.
45 occurs 1 times.
```

However, if we want to delve into the question, there is more to explain.

To be specific, the real input/output on my screen is [^*]

```
Input : 42 42 42 42 [Enter]
Output:	[nothing]
Input :	[any number of Enters]
Output:	[nothing]
Input :	[Ctrl-Z] [Enter]
Output: 42 occurs 4 times
```

```
Input :	42 43 44 44 [Enter]
Output: 42 occurs 1 times
        43 occurs 1 times
        44 occurs 1 times
Input :	[any number of Enters]
Output:	[nothing]
Input :	[Ctrl-Z] [Enter]
Output: 45 occurs 1 times
```

First understand that all the keyboard input before `Enter` is hit is buffered.

Then let's look at the two cases separately.

- After we enter the sequence `42 42 42 42` followed by one or more `Enter`, the `std::cin` is still good. waiting to read more numbers until it becomes invalid. At this point, we are still in the `while` loop, and there is no write to `std::cout`. Only after we hit the `Ctrl-Z` (followed by an `Enter`), which signals an *end-of-file* to the program, the result is written to `std::cout`.
- When we enter the sequence `42 43 44 45` followed by an `Enter`, the story is different. A different value will trigger write to `std::cout`. The output may be buffered. However, the standard requires that reading `std::cin` flushes the buffer of `std::cout` since the two streams are tied [^#]. Thus, reading `43` flushes `42 occurs 1 times`, ..., reading `45` flushes `44 occurs 1 times`. However, `45 occurs 1 times` is still buffered and not flushed. Any number of `Enter` does not flush it, until `Ctrl-Z` is hit.
