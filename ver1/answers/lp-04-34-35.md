**Exercise 4.34:** Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions:

(a) `if (fval)`

(b) `dval = fval + ival;`

(c) `dval + ival * cval;`

**Answer:** 

(a) `fval` is converted to `bool`: to `false` if it has value 0, to `true` if otherwise.

(b) `ival` is converted to `float`, and then the result is converted to `double`.

(c) integral promotion to raise `cval` to `int`, and then the product is converted to `double`.

**Exercise 4.35:** Given the following definitions,

```c++
char cval;   int ival;  unsigned int ui;
float fval;  double dval;
```

identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:

(a) `cval = 'a' + 3;`

(b) `fval = ui - ival * 1.0;`

(c) `dval = ui * fval;`

(d) `cval = ival + fval + dval;` 

**Answer:** 

(a) first integral promotion from `char` to `int`, then conversion from `int` to `char`.

(b) first `ival` is converted to `double`, then `ui` to `double`, finally in assignment the result to `float`.

(c) first `ui` is converted to `float`, to preserve precision, then the result is converted to `double`.

(d) first from `int` to `float`, then to `double`, finally to `char`.
