18/02/27 = Tue: `explicit` on a constructor that takes an `initializer_list`

**Exercise 12.4:** In our `check` function we didn’t check whether `i` was greater than zero. Why is it okay to omit that check?

```c++
class StrBlob {
    typedef std::vector<std::string>::size_type size_type;	// ...
};
void StrBlob::check(size_type i, const string &msg) const
{
    if (i >= data->size())
        throw out_of_range(msg);
}
```

**Answer:** `size_type` is an unsigned integral type, which is guaranteed to be `>= 0`.

*When a negative integer that is small in absolute value is passed, it becomes a very large positive integer, which will almost surely make the function throw an exception.*

**Exercise 12.5:** We did not make the constructor that takes an `initializer_list` `explicit` (*§ 7.5.4, p. 296*). Discuss the pros and cons of this design choice.

```c++
class StrBlob {
public:
	// ...
    StrBlob(std::initializer_list<std::string> il);
    // ...
};
```

**Answer:**  The rules for `explicit` are different are on list initialization than they are on other constructors.

- direct-list-initialization (both `explicit` and non-`explicit` constructors are considered)
- copy-list-initialization (both `explicit` and non-`explicit` constructors are considered, but only non-explicit constructors may be called)

Had we declared the list initializing constructor `explicit`, the complier would *still* consider the implicit conversion, but will complain rather than execute if that is the best match. Consider

```c++
class StrBlob {
public:
	// ...
    explicit StrBlob(initializer_list<string> il);
    explicit StrBlob(string s);
    // ...
};
void foo(const StrBlob & sb) {
    cout << "StrBlob" << endl;
}
void foo(const vector<string> & v) {
    cout << "vector<string>" << endl;
}
void foo(const string & s) {
    cout << "string" << endl;
}
StrBlob sb0 {"a", "an", "the"};   // okay
StrBlob sb1 = {"a", "an", "the"}; // compilation error
StrBlob sb2("a");                 // okay
StrBlob sb3((string("a"));        // okay
StrBlob sb4 = "a";                // compilation error
StrBlob sb5 = string("a");        // compilation error
foo({"a", "an", "the"});          // compilation error: ambiguity
foo("a");                         // okay, print "string"
foo(string("a"));                 // okay, print "string"
```

In general, declaring `explicit` makes the program hard to use but less error-prone. In this particular case where the constructor is used for list initialization, declaring `explicit` still cannot clarity the possible ambiguity in function call. The only inconvenience is that we cannot use copy form of list initialization.
