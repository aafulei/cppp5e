**Exercise 16.25:** Explain the meaning of these declarations:

```c++
extern template class vector<string>;
template class vector<Sales_data>;
```

**Answer:** `extern template class vector<string>;` is an instantiation declaration, which tells the compiler that `class vector<string>` is instantiated elsewhere so do not rush to generate the code. Instantiation is only invoked when the compiler sees `template class vector<string>;` which is the instantiation definition.

`template class vector<Sales_data>;` is an instantiation definition. When the compiler sees this, it will generate code.

**Exercise 16.26:** Assuming `NoDefault` is a class that does not have a default constructor, can we explicitly instantiate `vector<NoDefault>`? If not, why not?

**Answer:** No, because, unlike ordinary instantiation, the compiler will generate all the members in explicit instantiation. `NoDefault` cannot satisfy the requirement for the default constructor of `vector`.
