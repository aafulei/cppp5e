**Exercise 13.41:** Why did we use postfix increment in the call to construct inside `push_back`? What would happen if it used the prefix increment?

```c++
void StrVec::push_back(const string &s)
{
    chk_n_alloc(); // ensure that there is room for another element
    // construct a copy of s in the element to which first_free points
    alloc.construct(first_free++, s);
}
```

**Answer:** Because we work on the original end of the vector, which points to raw memory and has not been constructed yet, we should first construct on it, then increment the pointer. If we used the prefix increment, we would misplace the new element at the new end.
