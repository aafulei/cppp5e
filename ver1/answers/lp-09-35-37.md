**Exercise 9.35:** Explain the difference between a `vector`’s `capacity` and its `size`.

**Answer:**

- `size` : number of elements in a `vector` -- what it currently holds
- `capacity` : amount of reserved space for a `vector` -- maximum number that it may hold before more space must be allocated

**Exercise 9.36:** Can a container have a `capacity` less than its `size`?

**Answer:** No.

**Exercise 9.37:** Why don’t `list` or `array` have a `capacity` member?

**Answer:** A `list` need not reserve space because the elements are not stored in contiguous memory. An `array` has fixed size and need not to reallocate.
