**Exercise 4.17:** Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

**Answer:**

| prefix increment                         | postfix increment                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `++i`                                    | `i++`                                    |
| increment `i` by 1 and returns the new `i` | increment `i` by 1 but returns a copy of the original `i` |

**Exercise 4.18:** What would happen if the `while` loop on *page 148* that prints the elements from a `vector` used the prefix increment operator?

**Exercise 4.19:** Given that `ptr` points to an `int`, that `vec` is a `vector<int>`, and that `ival` is an `int`, explain the behavior of each of these expressions. Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might
each be corrected?

(a) `ptr != 0 && *ptr++`

(b) `ival++ && ival`

(c) `vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]`
