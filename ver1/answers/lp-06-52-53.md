**Exercise 6.52:** Given the following declarations,

```c++
void manip(int, int);
double dobj;
```

what is the rank (*ยง 6.6.1, p. 245*) of each conversion in the following calls?

(a) `manip('a', 'z');`

(b) `manip(55.4, dobj);`

**Answer:** (a) 3rd rank -- integral promotion; (b) 4th rank -- arithmetic conversion.

1. exact match (identical, array/function-to-pointer, top-level const)
2. const conversion
3. integral promotion
4. arithmetic/pointer conversion
5. class-type conversion

**Exercise 6.53:** Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.

(a)

```c++
int calc(int&, int&);
int calc(const int&, const int&);
```

(b)

```c++
int calc(char*, char*);
int calc(const char*, const char*);
```

(c)

```c++
int calc(char, char);
int calc(char* const, char* const);
```

**Answer:** (a) and (b) offer better matches for arguments with low-level const. (c) is illegal because merely top-level const does not differentiate the arguments.
