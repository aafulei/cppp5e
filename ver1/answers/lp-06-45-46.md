**Exercise 6.45:** Review the programs youâ€™ve written for the earlier exercises and decide whether they should be defined as inline. If so, do so. If not, explain why they should not be inline.

**Answer:** `inline` suggested if the functions are simple and frequently called.

**Exercise 6.46:** Would it be possible to define `isShorter` as a `constexpr`? If so, do so. If not, explain why not.

```c++
inline bool isShorter(const string & s1, const string & s2)
{	return s1.size() < s2.size(); }
```

**Answer:** No. `string` is not a literal type.
