**Exercise 11.1:** Describe the differences between a `map` and a `vector`.

**Answer:** 

- `map` is an associative container that stores and retrieves its element using a key.
- `vector` is a sequential container that stores and accesses its element by its position.

**Exercise 11.2:** Give an example of when each of `list`, `vector`, `deque`, `map`, and `set` might be most useful.

**Answer:** 

`list` to model a touring plan to visit a list of places of interests

`vector` to hold the rainfall history of California

`deque` to model a moving window in a time series, for example, a moving 3-month period in 10 years

`map` to hold a dictionary -- key for word and value for definition

`set` to hold a set of words to exclude -- efficient queries as to whether a word is in the set
