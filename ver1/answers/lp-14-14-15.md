**Exercise 14.14:** Why do you think it is more efficient to define `operator+` to call `operator+=` rather than the other way around?

**Answer:** If we worked the other way around, calling both `operator+` and `operator+=` would have to construct a new object, which is unnecessary in the efficient approach, where only calling `operator+` would require a new object to be constructed.

*See Exercise 14.21 for the analysis on `Sales_data`.*

**Exercise 14.15:** Should the class you chose for exercise 7.40 from *ยง 7.5.1 (p. 291)* define any of the arithmetic operators? If so, implement them. If not, explain why not.

```c++
class Book
{
	string isbn;
	string title;
	string author;
	// ...
};
```

**Answer:** No. Because we use `Book` in the sense of publication, not in the sense of copies, the arithmetic operators are not naturally meaningful.
