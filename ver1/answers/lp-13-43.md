**Exercise 13.43:** Rewrite the `free` member to use `for_each` and a lambda (*ยง 10.3.2, p. 388*) in place of the for loop to destroy the elements. Which implementation do you prefer, and why?

```c++
void StrVec::free()
{
    // may not pass deallocate a 0 pointer; if elements is 0, there's no work to do
    if (elements) {
        // destroy the old elements in reverse order
        for (auto p = first_free; p != elements; /* empty */)
            alloc.destroy(--p);
        alloc.deallocate(elements, cap - elements);
    }
}
```

**Answer:** I prefer the loop version:

```c++
while (e != b)
	alloc.destroy(--e);
```

which is simple and clear than the `for_each`-and-lambda version:

```c++
for_each(reverse_iterator<string *>(e), reverse_iterator<string *>(b),
         [](string & s){ a.destroy(&s); });
```

Pedantically, we should destroy the elements in a reverse order, because destruction should reverse everything that construction does. To do so, we need to additionally construct a pair of reverse iterators.

The version below also works but is not strict:

```c++
for_each(b, e, [](string & s){ a.destroy(&s); });
```
