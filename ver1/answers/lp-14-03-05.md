**Exercise 14.3:** Both `string` and `vector` define an overloaded `==` that can be used to compare objects of those types. Assuming `svec1` and `svec2` are vectors that hold strings, identify which version of `==` is applied in each of the following expressions:

(a) `"cobble" == "stone" `

(b) `svec1[0] == svec2[0]`

(c) `svec1 == svec2`

(d) `svec1[0] == "stone"`

**Answer:**

(a) neither

(b) library `string` version

(c) library `vector<string>` version

(d) library `string` version

**Exercise 14.4:** Explain how to decide whether the following should be class members:

(a) %

(b) %=

(c) ++

(d) ->

(e) <<

(f) &&

(g) ==

(h) ()

**Answer:**

(a) %	nonmember to allow conversion between mixed types

(b) %=	member since it's change the state of the object

(c) ++	member	since it's change the state of the object

(d) ->	member since it must be

(e) <<	nonmember to follow the convention that the `ostream` is put in the left-hand

(f) &&	shouldn't overload, if you have to, then nonmember since it's symmetric

(g) ==	nonmember since it's symmetric

(h) ()	member since it must be

**Exercise 14.5:** In *exercise 7.40* from *ยง 7.5.1 (p. 291)* you wrote a sketch of one of the following classes. Decide what, if any, overloaded operators your class should provide.

(a) Book

(b) Date

(c) Employee

(d) Vehicle

(e) Object

(f) Tree

**A Peek at the Answer for Exercise 7.40:** 

```c++
class Book {
	string isbn;
	string title;
	string author;
public:
	Book(string isbn, string title = "", string author = "") : 
	isbn(isbn), title(title), author(author) {}
};
```

**Answer:** We could overload input and output operators, and `==` for comparison.
