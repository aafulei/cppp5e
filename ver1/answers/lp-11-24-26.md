**Exercise 11.24:** What does the following program do?

```c++
map<int, int> m;
m[0] = 1;
```

**Answer:** Insert `{0, 1}` into `m`.

**Exercise 11.25:** Contrast the following program with the one in the previous exercise

```c++
vector<int> v;
v[0] = 1;
```

**Answer:** Tries to assign 1 to `v[0]`, but is an undefined behavior as `v` is empty.

**Exercise 11.26:** What type can be used to subscript a `map`? What type does the subscript operator return? Give a concrete exampleâ€”that is, define a map and then write the types that can be used to subscript the map and the type that would be returned from the subscript operator.

**Answer:** 

```c++
map<int, string> m;
map<int, string>::key_type i = 0;	// i is an int
map<int, string>::mapped_type s;	// s is a string
s = m[i] = "zero";
```
