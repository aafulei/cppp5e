**Exercise 4.29:** Predict the output of the following code and explain your reasoning. Now run the program. Is the output what you expected? If not, figure out why.

```c++
int x[10];   int *p = x;
cout << sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x) << endl;
cout << sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p) << endl;
```

**Answer:** The output is

10

I don't know (On my machine that turns out to be 8 / 4 = 2)

`sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x)` returns the size of the array `x[10]`, which is 10.

`sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p)` returns the size of `int *` divided by the size of `int`, both of which are not specified.

**Exercise  4.30:**  Using  *Table  4.12  (p.  166)*,  parenthesize  the  following expressions to match the default evaluation:

(a) `sizeof x + y`

(b) `sizeof p->mem[i]`

(c) `sizeof a < b`

(d) `sizeof f()`

**Answer:** 

(a) `(sizeof x) + y`

(b) `sizeof ((p->mem)[i])`

(c) `(sizeof a) < b`

(d) `sizeof (f())`
