**Exercise 4.36:** Assuming `i` is an `int` and `d` is a `double` write the expression `i *= d` so that it does integral, rather than floating-point, multiplication.

**Answer:** `i *= static_cast<int>(d)`

**Exercise 4.37:** Rewrite each of the following old-style casts to use a named cast:

```c++
int i;
double d;
const string *ps;
char *pc;
void *pv;
```

(a) `pv = (void*)ps;`

(b) `i = int(*pc);`

(c) `pv = &d`;

(d) `pc = (char*) pv;`

**Answer:** 

(a) `INCORRECT: const_cast<void *> ...`  `pv = const_cast<string *>(ps);`

(b) `i = static_cast<int>(*pc); // though automatically implicit integral promotion`

(c) `pv = static_cast<void *>(&d); // though (void *) may hold any type of non-const pointers`

(d) `INCORRECT: reinterpret_cast` `pc = static_cast<char *>(pv);` 

**Exercise 4.38:** Explain the following expression:

```c++
double slope = static_cast<double>(j/i);
```

**Answer:** Do integral division of `j/i`, then explicitly convert the result from an `int` to a `double` and initialize `slope` from it.
