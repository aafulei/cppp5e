**Exercise 5.7:** Correct the errors in each of the following code fragments:

(a)

```c++
if (ival1 != ival2)
    ival1 = ival2
else ival1 = ival2 = 0;
```

(b)

```c++
if (ival < minval)
    minval = ival;
    occurs = 1;
```
(c)

```c++
if (int ival = get_value())
    cout << "ival = " << ival << endl;
if (!ival)
    cout << "ival = 0\n";
```

(d)

```c++
if (ival = 0)
    ival = get_value();
```

**Answer:** 

(a)

```c++
if (ival1 != ival2)
	ival1 = ival2;
else
	ival1 = ival2 = 0;
```

(b)

```c++
if (ival < minval) {
	minval = ival;
	occurs = 1;
}
```

(c)

```c++
if (int ival = get_value())
    cout << "ival = " << ival << endl;
else
    cout << "ival = 0\n";
```

(d)

```c++
if (ival == 0)
    ival = get_value();
```

**Exercise 5.8:** What is a “dangling `else`”? How are `else` clauses resolved in C++?

**Answer:** An issue that arises when there are more `if` than `else`. In C++, `else` corresponds to the closest preceding unmatched `if`.
