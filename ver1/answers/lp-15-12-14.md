**Exercise 15.12:** Is it ever useful to declare a member function as both `override` and `final`? Why or why not?

**Answer:** Yes, if that virtual function overrides a virtual function in its base class and forbids any function in its derived classes from overriding it.

**Exercise 15.13:** Given the following classes, explain each `print` function:

```c++
class base {
public:
   string name() { return basename; }
   virtual void print(ostream &os) { os << basename; }
private:
   string basename;
};
class derived : public base {
public:
   void print(ostream &os) { print(os); os << " " << i; }
private:
   int i;
};
```

If there is a problem in this code, how would you fix it?

**Answer:** `base::print()` prints out `basename`. `derived::print()` tries to first print out `basename` followed by `i`, separated by a blank. However, `derived::print()` would cause an infinite recursion because it is calling itself in dynamic binding. To fix it,

```c++
    void print(ostream &os) { base::print(os); os << " " << i; }
```

**Exercise 15.14:** Given the classes from the previous exercise and the following objects, determine which function is called at run time:

```c++
base bobj;     base *bp1 = &bobj;   base &br1 = bobj;
derived dobj;  base *bp2 = &dobj;   base &br2 = dobj; 
(a) bobj.print(); 
(b) dobj.print(); 
(c) bp1->name(); 
(d) bp2->name(); 
(e) br1.print(); 
(f) br2.print();
```

**Answer:** 

(a) compile time, `base::print`

(b) compile time, `derived::print`

(c) compile time, `base::name`

(d) compile time, `base::name`

(e) run time, `base::print`

(f) run time, `derived::print`
