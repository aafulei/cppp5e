// Question: Are there better ways other than this or using a goto?

// Exercise 5.25: Revise your program from the previous exercise to use a try block to catch the exception. The catch clause should print a message to the user and ask them to supply a new number and repeat the code inside the try.

// Exercise 5.24: Revise your program to throw an exception if the second number is zero. Test your program with a zero input to see what happens on your system if you donâ€™t catch an exception.

// Exercise 5.23: Write a program that reads two integers from the standard input and prints the result of dividing the first number by the second.
