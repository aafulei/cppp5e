**Exercise 10.7:** Determine if there are any errors in the following programs and, if so, correct the error(s):

(a)

```c++
vector<int> vec; list<int> lst; int i;
while (cin >> i)
	lst.push_back(i);
copy(lst.cbegin(), lst.cend(), vec.begin());
```

(b)

```c++
vector<int> vec;
vec.reserve(10); // reserve is covered in § 9.4 (p. 356)
fill_n(vec.begin(), 10, 0);
```

**Answer:**

(a) `vec` is empty. Thus copying into `vec` is undefined. To correct, replace`vec.begin()` with `back_inserter(vec)` . (Note that the header `<iterator>` should be included to use `std::back_inserter`.)

(b) `fill_n` assumes there is room to write 10 elements but there is not, since `reserve` changes only the capacity, not the size. The result is undefined. To correct, replace `vec.reserve(10)` with `vec.resize(10)`.

**Exercise 10.8:** We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers over which they operate. Why doesn’t the use of `back_inserter` invalidate this claim?

**Answer:** The algorithm itself does not change the size of the container. What changes the container size is the inserter.
