#### Chapter 8 The IO Library

**What is a Stream?**

A *stream* is a sequence of data read from or written to an IO device.

- it is processed in a sequential order over time (i.e. one by one);
- it is interpreted in the format as the user wishes.

Consider

```C++
int a;
double b;
char c;
std::cin >> a;
std::cin >> b;
std::cin >> c;
```

Suppose we enter `1 1 1 ` , then the first 1 would be interpreted as an `int` , the second one a `double` , and the third one a `char` .

**From What to What?**

Consider

```c++
std::string s1 = "Hello, ";
std::string s2 = "World !";
std::cout << s1 << s2;
```

##### 8.1 The IO Classes

1. No Copy or Assignment
2. Condition States
3. Managing the Buffer

> Where is `wostringstream` define?

`<sstream>`

> Given `void foo(istream & is)` can we pass an `istringstream` to `foo`?

Yes.

*We can use an object of an inherited class as if it were an object of the same type as the the class from which it inherits.*

> Why cannot the reference be `const` even if we read an IO object?

Reading an IO object may change its state.

> Name the flags and functions to access the condition state of a stream

| `strm::iostate` | indicates                            | `.good()` | `.eof()` | `.fail()` | `.bad()` |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| `strm::goodbit` | no errors                            | **true**  | false    | false     | false    |
| `strm::eofbit`  | end-of-file                          | false     | **true** | false     | false    |
| `strm::failbit` | recoverable logical errors           | false     | false    | **true**  | false    |
| `strm::badbit`  | irrecoverable reading/writing errors | false     | false    | **true**  | true     |

*`strm` represents an IO type, for example, `istream`.*

> What is an `iostate`?

A machine-dependent integral type whose value (e.g. `goodbit`) represents the condition state of a stream. `goodbit` is guaranteed to have value 0. This type can be manipulated with bitwise operators.

> What `iostate` does reaching end-of-file set?

Both `eofbit` and `failbit`.

> What IO class member function is equivalent to `cin >> num` as in `while (cin >> num)`?

`!cin.fail()`

> Give an example where `s.good()` differs from `!s.fail()`.

When only `eofbit` is set for `s`, `s.good()` returns `false`, but `!s.fail()` returns `true`. Consider

```c++
cin.clear();
cin.setstate(iostream::eofbit);
cerr << boolalpha;
cerr << cin.good() << endl;
cerr << !cin.fail() << endl;
```

> 	std::cin >> data.book_number >> data.quantity >> price;
> 	data.revenue = price * data.quantity;

> What would happen if we do so?

No. We are likely to miss the last piece of records, if we read records using a loop like `while (read(data))`.

`true`

> Why do we use a buffer?

Combining several program-level output operations into a system-level write saves time.

> List cases that cause a buffer to be flushed.

1. when program completes normally [^*]
2. when the buffer becomes full
3. when a manipulator such as `std::endl` or `std::flush` is used
4. when manipulator `std::unitbuf` is used
5. when a tied stream is accessed, for example, reading `cin` causes buffer of `cout` to be flushed

[^*]: However, when the program crashes (terminates abnormally), the buffer may not be flushed.

`std::ostream *`. 

`&std::cout`. 

Tie `std::cin` to `std::cerr` so that reading `cin` flushes `cerr`. Assign to `pos3` a pointer to which `cin` was previously tied. Since `cin` wasn't tied to any `ostream`, `pos3` has value `nullptr`.

*Note that `&` is the address-of operator. Nothing to do with reference.*

##### 8.2 File Input and Output

> What are the only ways to preserve the contents of a existing file opened with `ofstream::out`?

Specify `std::ofstream::app` or `std::ofstream::in` for the file mode.

##### 8.3 `string` Streams

> Assume `str` is a `string`, and `iss` is an `istringstream`.
>
> How to let `str` hold a copy `iss`?
>
> How to let `iss` to hold a copy of `str`?

```c++
str = iss.str();
iss.str(str);
```

> We have already had `string`. What extra value does `stringstream` provide?

It is useful when we first get line, and then deal with the words in the line one by one. In such cases, we may convert the line into an ` istringstream`. Or, by using an `ostringstream`, we can build the output a little at a time, which we do not print until later.
