**Exercise 6.28:** In the second version of error_msg that has an `ErrCode` parameter, what is the type of `elem` in the for loop?

```c++
void error_msg(ErrCode e, initializer_list<string> il)
{
    cout << e.msg() << ": ";
    for (const auto &elem : il)
        cout << elem << " " ;
    cout << endl;
}
```

**Answer:** `const string &`

**Exercise 6.29:** When you use an `initializer_list` in a range for would you ever use a reference as the loop control variable? If so, why? If not, why not?

**Answer:** Yes, if the element type is expensive to copy. `const auto &` is suggested, to make it clear that we promise not to change any element in the list. However, since the elements in an `initializer_list` are `const` automatically, it should be the same if we just deduce by `auto &`.
