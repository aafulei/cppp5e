// Exercise 1.2: Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

// To see the failure indicator, enter "echo %ERRORLEVEL%" in command prompt

int main()
{
	return -1;
}
