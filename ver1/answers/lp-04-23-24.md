**Exercise 4.23:** The following expression fails to compile due to operator precedence. Using *Table 4.12 (p. 166)*, explain why it fails. How would you fix it?

```c++
string s = "word";
string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ;
```

**Answer:** Conditional operator `?:` is higher in precedence than assignment operator `=`.

```c++
string s = "word";
string pl = s + (s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s");
```

**Exercise 4.24:** Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass, and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is *right* associative. Describe how that operator would be valuated if the operator were *left* associative.

```c++
final_grade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";
```

**Answer:** ==It would be==

```c++
final_grade = ((grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60)) ? "fail" : "pass";
```

Always `"fail"`.
