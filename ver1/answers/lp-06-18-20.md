**Exercise 6.18:** Write declarations for each of the following functions. When you write these declarations, use the name of the function to indicate what the function does.

(a) A function named `compare` that returns a `bool` and has two parameters that are references to a class named `matrix`.

(b) A function named `change_val` that returns a `vector<int>` iterator and takes two parameters: One is an `int` and the other is an iterator for a `vector<int>`.

**Answer:** 

(a) 

```c++
bool compare(const matrix &, const matrix &);
```

(b)

```c++
vector<int>::iterator change_val(int, vector<int>::iterator);
```

**Exercise 6.19:** Given the following declarations, determine which calls are legal and which are illegal. For those that are illegal, explain why.

```c++
double calc(double);
int count(const string &, char);
int sum(vector<int>::iterator, vector<int>::iterator, int);
vector<int> vec(10);
```

(a) `calc(23.4, 55.1);`

(b) `count("abcda", 'a');`

(c) `calc(66);`

(d) `sum(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3.8);`

**Answer:**

(a) illegal, because the number of arguments mismatch with that of parameters.

(b) legal.

(c) legal  (conversion from `int` to `double` is possible).

(d) legal (conversion from `double` to `int` is possible).

**Exercise 6.20**: When should reference parameters be references to const? What happens if we make a parameter a plain reference when it could be a reference to const?

**Answer:** Whenever the function does not change the value of the parameters. Then we would fail in passing const objects and literals that are possible to bind to references to const.
