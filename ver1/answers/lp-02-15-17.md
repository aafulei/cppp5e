**Exercise 2.15** Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why?

(a) `int ival = 1.01;`

(b) `int &rval1 = 1.01;`

(c) `int &rval2 = ival;`

(d) `int &rval3;`

**Answer:** (b) and (d) are invalid.

For (b), we cannot bind a reference to a literal (unless the reference is a reference-to-const).

For (d), reference must be initialized.

**Exercise 2.16:** Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.

`int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;`

(a) `r2 = 3.14159;`

(b) `r2 = r1;`

(c) `i = r2;`

(d) `r1 = d;`

**Answer:** 

(a) valid, assign 3.14159 to `d`, to which `r2` refers.

(b) valid, assign value of `i` to `d`, with type conversion.

(c) valid, assign value of `d` to `i`, with type conversion.

(d) valid, assign value of `d` to `i`, with type conversion.

**Exercise 2.17:** What does the following code print?

```c++
int i, &ri = i;
i = 5; ri = 10;
std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;
```

**Answer:** 10 10.
