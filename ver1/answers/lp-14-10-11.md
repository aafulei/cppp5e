**Exercise 14.10:** Describe the behavior of the `Sales_data` input operator if given the following input:

(a) 0-201-99999-9 10 24.95

(b) 10 24.95 0-210-99999-9

```c++
istream & operator>>(istream & is, Sales_data & item)
{
    double price;
    is >> item.bookNo >> item.units_sold >> price;
    if (is)
        item.revenue = item.units_sold * price;
    else
        item = Sales_data();
    return is;
}
```

**Answer:**

(a) An item is read with ISBN 0-201-99999-9, 10 units sold, and a revenue of 249.5.

(b) The item is assigned with an empty `Sales_data()`.

**Exercise 14.11:** What, if anything, is wrong with the following `Sales_data` input operator? What would happen if we gave this operator the data in the previous exercise?

```c++
istream & operator>>(istream & in, Sales_data & s)
{
    double price;
    in >> s.bookNo >> s.units_sold >> price;
    s.revenue = s.units_sold * price;
    return in;
}
```

**Answer:** There is no error recovery regarding possible reading failure.

(a) would be same.

(b) would have undefined behavior.
