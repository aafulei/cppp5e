**Exercise 10.4:** Assuming `v` is a `vector<double>`, what, if anything, is wrong with calling `accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 0)`?

**Answer:** The return type, determined by `0` , or the third argument in `accumulate()` , is `int` , which may lead to a loss in precision.

**Exercise 10.5:** In the call to `equal` on rosters, what would happen if both rosters held C-style strings, rather than library `string`s?

**Answer:** The `==` defined for C-style strings compares the address value, not the string value. It compares the pointers that point to the first elements of the two char arrays. It is possible to return a `false` , no matter the values of the strings are the same or not.
