**Exercise 2.9:** Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.

(a) `std::cin >> int input_value;`

(b) `int i = { 3.14 };`

(c) `double salary = wage = 9999.99;`

(d) `int i = 3.14;`

**Answer:**

(a) Illegal.

```c++
int input_value;
std::cin >> input_value;
```

(b) Illegal. List initialization does not allow narrowing conversion.

```c++
int i = 3.14;
```

(c) Illegal.

```c++
double salary, wage;
salary = wage = 9999.99;
```

Alternatively,

```c++
double salary = 9999.99, wage = 9999.99;
```

(d) Legal. Define`i` to be an `int` and initialize it with value `3`, which is a truncated from `3.14`.

**Exercise 2.10:** What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?

```c++
std::string global_str;
int global_int;
int main()
{
	int local_int;
	std::string local_str;
}
```

**Answer:** 

`global_str` is an empty `string`.

`global_int` has value 0.

`local_int` has undefined value.

`local_str` is an empty `string`.

**Exercise 2.11:** Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definition:

(a) `extern int ix = 1024;`

(b) `int iy;`

(c) `extern int iz;`

**Answer:** (a) definition; (b) definition; (c) declaration.

*(a) providing an explicit initializer overrides `extern` and make it a definition.*

**Exercise 2.12:** Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?

(a) `int double = 3.14;`

(b) `int _;`

(c) `int catch-22;`

(d) `int 1_or_2 = 1;`

(e) `double Double = 3.14;`

**Answer:** (a), (d), (d) are invalid. (b) is not recommended. (e) is not a good name either.

**Exercise 2.13:** What is the value of `j` in the following program?

```c++
int i = 42;
int main()
{
    int i = 100;
    int j = i;
}
```

**Answer:** 100.

**Exercise 2.14:** Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?

```c++
int i = 100, sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
     sum += i;
std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;
```

**Answer:** Yes. 100 45.
