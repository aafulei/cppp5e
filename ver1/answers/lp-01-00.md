#### Chapter 1 Getting Started

##### 1.1 Write a Simple C++ Program

> On a Windows system, how to view the value returned by `main`?

Enter `echo %ERRORLEVEL%` in command prompt.

##### 1.2 A First Look at Input/Output

> Name four objects (and their types) defined by `iostream`.

- `std::istream`:  `std::cin`
- `std::ostream`: `std::cout`, `std::cerr`, `std::clog`


> What does `std::cout << "1 + 2 = " << 1 + 2` return? 

`std::cout`

##### 1.3 A Word about Comments

> In debugging, it is common to comment out a block of lines. It is suggest that we use `//` rather than `/*` and `*/` to do so. Why?

Paired comments cannot be nested. Consider:

```c++
for (int i = 0; /* TO DO */ ; ++i) {
	/* TO DO */
}
```

If we comment out the above lines using a paired `/*` and `*/`, it would be a disaster:

```C++
/* for (int i = 0; /* TO DO */ ; ++i) {
	/* TO DO */
} */
```

> Is `std::cout << /*  "*/" /* "/*"  */;` legal?

Yes.

##### 1.4 Flow of Control

> Is the following line legal?
>
> ```c++
> for ( ; 0; ) {}
> ```

Yes.

*A block is a sequence of zero or more statements enclosed by curly braces. A block is a statement and may be used wherever a statement is required.*

> Are the following `for` loops legal?
>
> ```c++
> for (int i = 0, j = 0; i + j < 10; ++i)
>     ;
> for (int i = 0, j = 0; i + j < 10; ++i, ++j)
>     ;
> for (int i = 0, double j = 0; i + j < 10; ++i)
>     ;
> ```

Yes. Yes. No.

> How to indicate *end-of-file* on a Windows system? On a Mac?

`Ctrl-Z` `Ctrl-D`

##### 1.5 Introducing Classes

In fact, a primary focus of the design of C++ is to make it possible to define **class types** that behave as *naturally* as the built-in types.
