**Exercise 11.27: ** What kinds of problems would you use `count` to solve? When might you use `find` instead?

**Answer:** Use `count` to count the number of occurrences for a given key in a `multimap` or a `multiset`. Use `find` to find the first occurrence, if any, of a key in an associative container.

**Exercise 11.28:** Define and initialize a variable to hold the result of calling `find` on a map from `string` to `vector` of `int`.

**Answer:**

```c++
extern map<string, vector<int>> m;
map<string, vector<int>>::iterator it = m.find("");
```

**Exercise 11.29:** What do `upper_bound`, `lower_bound`, and `equal_range` return when you pass them a key that is not in the container?

**Answer:** `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` an iterator which refer to the point at which the key can be inserted without disrupt the order. `equal_range` returns a pair of iterators, both refer to the position where the key can be inserted.

**Exercise 11.30:** Explain the meaning of the operand `pos.first->second` used in the output expression of the final program in this section.

```c++
// definitions of authors and search_item as above
// pos holds iterators that denote the range of elements for this key
for (auto pos = authors.equal_range(search_item);
     pos.first != pos.second; ++pos.first)
    cout << pos.first->second << endl; // print each title
```

**Answer:** `pos` is a `pair` of iterators, say, `b` and `e`. `[b, e)` denote the range where the key is `search_item`. `pos.first->second` accesses the mapped value of the element to which the `first`  iterator refers.
