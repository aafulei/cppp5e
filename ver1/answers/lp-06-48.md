**Exercise 6.48:** Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of `assert`:

```c++
string s;
while (cin >> s && s != sought) { }  // empty body
assert(cin);
```

**Answer:** Repeatedly read standard input to a `string`, whose name is `s`, until the standard input fails or `sought` is read.

No, it is not a good use of `assert`, because `assert` should not be used to perform run-time check.
