**Exercise 12.21:** We could have written `StrBlobPtr`â€™s `deref` member as follows:

```c++
std::string& deref() const
{ return (*check(curr, "dereference past end"))[curr]; }
```

Which version do you think is better and why?

Original version:

```c++
std::string& StrBlobPtr::deref() const
{
  auto p = check(curr, "dereference past end");
  return (*p)[curr]; // (*p) is the vector to which this object points
}
```

**Answer:** The original version is more readable. Nonetheless, to be honest, I don't think having a function named `check` return an entity is a good idea anyway. By its name, `check` should return a `bool` only. Write another function to return a `shared_ptr` if `check` is `true`.
