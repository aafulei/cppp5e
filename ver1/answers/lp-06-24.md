**Exercise 6.24:** Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.

```c++
void print(const int ia[10])
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        cout << ia[i] << endl;
}
```

**Answer:** Compiler will not verify the size of `ia`. What is really passed is a `const int *`.

```c++
template<size_t N>
void print(int (&a)[N])
{
	for (auto i : a)
		cout << i << endl;
}
```
