**Exercise 4.1:** What is the value returned by `5 + 10 * 20 / 2`?

**Answer:** 105.

**Exercise 4.2:** Using *Table 4.12* (*p. 166*), parenthesize the following expressions to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped:

(a) `* vec.begin()`

(b) `* vec.begin() + 1`

**Answer:** 

(a) `*(vec.begin())`

(b) `(*(vec.begin())) + 1`

**Exercise 4.3:** Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

**Answer:** Yes. The general principle is dedicate each statement to a single aim. To that end, I strongly discourage any expression that uses and changes one object at the same time, except when there is no room for ambiguity like `*++iter`.
