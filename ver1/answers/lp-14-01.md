**Exercise 14.1:** In what ways does an overloaded operator differ from a built-in operator? In what ways are overloaded operators the same as the built-in operators?

**Answer:**

Differences:

- An overloaded operator does not guarantee the order of execution, which is guaranteed by built-in operators including `&&`, `||`, `,` and `?:`.

- An overloaded operator must have at least one of its operands as class types.

- We may call an overloaded operator like calling an ordinary function. For example,

  ```c++
  operator+(a, b);
  ```

Similarities:

- An overloaded operator may be called in the same way as the built-in operator.


- An overloaded operator has the same precedence and associativity as a built-in operator.
