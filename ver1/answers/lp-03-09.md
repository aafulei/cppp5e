**Exercise 3.9:** What does the following program do? Is it valid? If not, why not?

```c++
string s;
cout << s[0] << endl;
```

**Answer:** Invalid. `s` is an empty string. Subscripting an empty string is *undefined*. To avoid so, change `cout << s[0] << endl` to

```c++
if (!s.empty())
	cout << s[0] << endl;
```
