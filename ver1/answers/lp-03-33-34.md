**Exercise 3.33:** What would happen if we did not initialize the `scores` array in the program on *page 116*?

```c++
unsigned scores[11] = {}; // 11 buckets, all value initialized to 0
unsigned grade;
while (cin >> grade) {
      if (grade <= 100)
		++scores[grade/10]; // increment the counter for the current cluster
}
```

**Answer:** `scores` would have 11 `unsigned` elements of undefined values.

**Exercise 3.34:** Given that `p1` and `p2` point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do? Are there values of `p1` or `p2` that make this code illegal?

```c++
p1 += p2 - p1;
```

**Answer:** `p1` points to the same element as does `p2`. No.
