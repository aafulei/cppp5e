**Exercise 9.23 :** In the first program in this section on *page 346*, what would the values of `val` , `val2` , `val3` , and `val4` be if `c.size()` is 1?

```c++
if (!c.empty()) {
    // val and val2 are copies of the value of the first element in c
    auto val = *c.begin(), val2 = c.front();
    // val3 and val4 are copies of the of the last element in c
    auto last = c.end();
    auto val3 = *(--last); // can't decrement forward_list iterators
    auto val4 = c.back();  // not supported by forward_list
}
```

**Answer :** All of them would have the value of the only element.
