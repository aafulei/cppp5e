**Exercise 6.16:** The following function, although legal, is less useful than it might be. Identify and correct the limitation on this function: 

```c++
bool is_empty(string& s) { return s.empty(); }
```

**Answer:** Since the function does not change `s`, the reference should be declared as a reference-to-const.

```c++
bool is_empty(const string & s)
{
	return s.empty();
}
```
