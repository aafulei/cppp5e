**Exercise 16.40:** Is the following function legal? If not, why not? If it is legal, what, if any, are the restrictions on the argument type(s) that can be passed, and what is the return type?

```c++
template <typename It>
auto fcn3(It beg, It end) -> decltype(*beg + 0)
{
    // process the range
    return *beg; // return a copy of an element from the range
}
```

**Answer:** Yes, it's legal, which returns the value type of `*beg`, though `operator+` and addition with `0` must be supported by the type. For example, `fcn3` works for a sequence of `int` but does not work for a sequence of `string`.
