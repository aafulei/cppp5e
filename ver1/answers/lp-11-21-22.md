**Exercise 11.21:** Assuming `word_count` is a `map` from `string` to `size_t` and `word` is a `string`, explain the following loop:

```c++
while (cin >> word)
  ++word_count.insert({word, 0}).first->second;
```

**Answer:** In effect, this is equivalent to

```c++
while (cin >> word)
    ++word_count[word];
```

`word_count.insert({word, 0})` tries to insert a pair `{word, 0}` into `word_count`, which returns, in the first member of the pair returned, an iterator to the element with key `word` in `word_count`. Then the second member of that element is accessed and incremented, which is the count for `word`.

In one word, the loop reads and counts the words from the standard input.

**Exercise 11.22:** Given a `map<string, vector<int>>`, write the types used as an argument and as the return value for the version of insert that inserts one element.

**Answer:** 

```c++
map<string, vector<int>> m;
pair<string, vector<int>> p = {"", {}};
pair<map<string, vector<int>>::iterator, bool> q;
q = m.insert(p);
```
