**Exercise 7.56:** What is a `static` class member? What are the advantages of `static` members? How do they differ from ordinary members?

**Answer:** A class member that is associated with the entire class, rather than with any individual object.

> What are the advantages of `static` members?

- It can used to store values that are common to all objects, for example, the interest rate for all the bank accounts. When the value changes, we do not have to make changes for each object.
- It can be used in ways that ordinary members cannot. For example, it can have incomplete type. In particular, it may have the same type as that of the class that it belongs.

> How do they differ from ordinary members?

- A `static` data member does not belong to any object and thus should be defined outside the class.
- A `static` member function does not have the implicit `this` pointer and may not specified as `const`.
