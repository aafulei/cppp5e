**Exercise 15.8:** Define static type and dynamic type.

**Answer:** Of a variable or an expression,

- *static type* is the type with which the variable is declared or the expression yields, which is known at compile time
- *dynamic type* is the type of the object in the memory that the variable or expression represents, which is not known until run time.

**Exercise 15.9:** When is it possible for an expression’s static type to differ from its dynamic type? Give three examples in which the static and dynamic type differ.

**Answer:** When a pointer or a reference to the base class refers to a derived object. Consider

```c++
class B {
public:
    virtual f() {
        // ...
    }
    // ...
};
class D : B {
    virtual f() {
        // ...
    }
    // ...
};
void g(B & r) {
    r.f();
}
D d;
B * p = & d;
B & r = d;
p->f();  // example 1: p's static type is B *, while its dynamic type is D *.
r.f();   // example 2: r's static type is B &, while its dynamic type is D &.
g(r);    // example 3: the parameter's static type is B &, while its dynamic type is D &.
```

**Exercise 15.10:** Recalling the discussion from §8.1 (p. 311), explain how the program on *page 317* that passed an `ifstream` to the `Sales_data` `read` function works.

```c++
ifstream input(argv[1]);   // open the file of sales transactions
ofstream output(argv[2]);  // open the output file
Sales_data total;          // variable to hold the running sum
if (read(input, total)) {  // read the first transaction
// ...
```

**Answer:** `read()` takes a reference to `istream` as its first parameter. The argument is an `ifstream` which is a derived object whose base class is `istream`. When the argument of type `ifstream` is passed, `read()` binds it to a reference of `istream`. Derived-to-base conversion takes place.
