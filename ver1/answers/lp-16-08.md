**Exercise 16.8:** In the “Key Concept” box on *page 108*, we noted that as a matter of habit C++ programmers prefer using `!=` to using `<`. Explain the rationale for this habit.

**Answer:** It is the responsibility of the template user to ensure that the types supplied to the template support the operations that the template uses. More often a template requires `!= ` rather than `<`. Thus the code using `!=` can be supported more extensively.
