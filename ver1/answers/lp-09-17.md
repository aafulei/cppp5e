**Exercise 9.17:** Assuming `c1` and `c2` are containers, what (if any) constraints does the following usage place on the types of `c1` and `c2`?

```c++
if (c1 < c2)
```

**Answer:** `c1` and `c2` must have the same container type. The container type cannot be unordered associative. `<` must be defined for the element type.
