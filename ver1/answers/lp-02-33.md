**Exercise 2.33:** Using the variable definitions from this section, determine what happens in each of these assignments:

```c++
a = 42; b = 42; c = 42; d = 42; e = 42; g = 42;
```

```c++
int i = 0, &r = i;
auto a = r;  // a is an int (r is an alias for i, which has type int)
const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
auto b = ci;  // b is an int (top-level const in ci is dropped)
auto c = cr;  // c is an int (cr is an alias for ci whose const is top-level)
auto d = &i;  // d is an int* (& of an int object is int*)
auto e = &ci; // e is const int* (& of a const object is low-level const)
const auto f = ci; // deduced type of ci is int; f has type const int
auto &g = ci; // g is a const int& that is bound to ci
```

**Answer:** 

`a = 42;` assigns 42 to `a`.

`b = 42;` assigns 42 to `b`.

`c = 42;` assigns 42 to `c`.

`d = 42;` is invalid because `d` is an `int *`.

`e = 42;` is invalid because `e` is an `const int *`.

`g = 42;` is invalid because `g` has low-level `const`, which promises not to change `ci`.
