**Exercise 15.18:** Given the classes from *page 612* and *page 613*, and assuming each object has the type specified in the comments, determine which of these assignments are legal. Explain why those that are illegal arenâ€™t allowed:

```c++
Base *p = &d1;  //  d1 has type Pub_Derv
p = &d2;        //  d2 has type Priv_Derv
p = &d3;        //  d3 has type Prot_Derv
p = &dd1;       //  dd1 has type Derived_from_Public
p = &dd2;       //  dd2 has type Derived_from_Private
p = &dd3;       //  dd3 has type Derived_from_Protected
```

**Answer:**

```c++
Base *p = &d1;  //  d1 has type Pub_Derv: legal
p = &d2;        //  d2 has type Priv_Derv: illegal
p = &d3;        //  d3 has type Prot_Derv: illegal
p = &dd1;       //  dd1 has type Derived_from_Public: legal
p = &dd2;       //  dd2 has type Derived_from_Private: illegal
p = &dd3;       //  dd3 has type Derived_from_Protected: illegal
```

User code may use the derived-to-base conversion only when the inheritance is public.

**Exercise 15.19:** Assume that each of the classes from *page 612* and *page 613* has a member function of the form:

```c++
void memfcn(Base &b) { b = *this; }
```

**Answer:**

- `Pub_Derv`: legal
- `Priv_Derv`: legal
- `Prot_Derv`: legal
- `Derived_from_Public`: legal
- `Derived_from_Private`: illegal, because `Derived_from_Private` cannot see the inheritance relationship from `Base` to `Priv_Derv`, which is private
- `Derived_from_Protected`: legal
