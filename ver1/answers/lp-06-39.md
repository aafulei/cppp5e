**Exercise 6.39:** Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.

```c++
(a) int calc(int, int);
int calc(const int, const int);
(b) int get();
double get();
(c) int *reset(int *);
double *reset(double *);
```

**Answer:** (a) illegal, since the top-level const are ignored when arguments are passed.

(b) illegal, since only return types differ.

(c) legal.
