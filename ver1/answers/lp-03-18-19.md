**Exercise 3.18:** Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?
```c++
vector<int> ivec;
ivec[0] = 42;
```

**Answer :** Illegal. Should be
```c++
vector<int> ivec;
ivec.push_back(42);
```

**Exercise 3.19:** List three ways to define a `vector` and give it ten elements, each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so and why.

**Answer :** 

1. `vector<int> vec(10, 42);`

2. ```c++
   vector<int> vec;
   for (decltype(vec.size()) i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
   	vec.push_back(42)
   ```

3. `vector<int> vec = { 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42 };`

The first approach is preferred for simplicity.
