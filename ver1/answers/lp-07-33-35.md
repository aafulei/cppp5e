**Exercise 7.33:** What would happen if we gave `Screen` a size member defined as follows? Fix any problems you identify.

```c++
pos Screen::size() const
{	return height * width; }
```

**Answer:** Compiler cannot see `Screen` class scope when it reads `pos`.

```c++
Screen::pos Screen::size() const
{	return height * width; }
```

**Exercise 7.34:** What would happen if we put the `typedef` of `pos` in the `Screen` class on *page 285* as the last line in the class?

```c++
int height;   // defines a name subsequently used inside Screen
class Screen {
public:
    typedef std::string::size_type pos;
    void dummy_fcn(pos height) {
        cursor = width * height; // which height? the parameter
    }
    private:
    pos cursor = 0;
    pos height = 0, width = 0;
};
```

**Answer:** The compiler would complain about *all* the occurrences of `pos` in this class definition, not just `dummy_fcn(pos height)`.

**Exercise 7.35:** Explain the following code, indicating which definition of `Type` or `initVal` is used for each use of those names. Say how you would fix any errors.

```c++
typedef string Type;
Type initVal();
class Exercise {
public:
	typedef double Type;
	Type setVal(Type);
	Type initVal();
private:
  int val;
};
Type Exercise::setVal(Type parm) {
	val = parm + initVal();
	return val;
}
```

**Answer:**  In class `Exercise` all the occurrences of `Type` stand for an alias of `double`.

In `Type Exercise::setVal(Type parm)`, the return type `Type` stands for `string`, while the parameter type `Type` as in `Type parm` stands for `double`.

The `initVal()` in the function `Exercise::setVal` is the version declared in `Exercise`, which returns `double`.

Therefore, there is a type mismatch between the value returned and the type specified in `Type Exercise::setVal(Type parm)`. To fix it, change `Type Exercise::setVal(Type parm)` to

```c++
Exercise::Type Exercise::setVal(Type parm)
```

Also, remember to define `initVal()` in the class `Excercise`.
