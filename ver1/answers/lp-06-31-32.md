**Exercise  6.31:**  When  is  it  valid  to  return  a  reference?  A  reference  to const?

**Answer:** When the reference refers to an object that exists after the called function ends. For a reference-to-const, as an additional requirement, the caller should promise not to change the object via the returned reference.

**Exercise 6.32:** Indicate whether the following function is legal. If so, explain what it does; if not, correct any errors and then explain it.

```c++
int &get(int *arry, int index) { return arry[index]; }
int main() {
    int ia[10];
    for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        get(ia, i) = i;
}
```

**Answer:** Yes, it is legal. It assigns to elements of array `ia[10]` their indices.
