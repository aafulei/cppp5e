**Exercise 15.21:** Choose one of the following general abstractions containing a family of types (or choose one of your own). Organize the types into an inheritance hierarchy:

(a) Graphical file formats (such as gif, tiff, jpeg, bmp)

(b) Geometric primitives (such as box, circle, sphere, cone)

(c) C++ language types (such as class, function, member function)

**Answer:** We choose (c).

A *class* is a collection of *member*s, including *data member*s and *member function*s.

A *member function* is a *member*.

**Exercise 15.22:** For the class you chose in the previous exercise, identify some of the likely virtual functions as well as public and protected members.

**Answer:** A *member* has a *name*, a *type* and an *access level*, all of which could be protected members. A *member function* has a *return type* and a *parameter list*, both of which could also be protected members, too. The function to change a member could be virtual, because a *member function* has more fields to change than an ordinary *data member*.
