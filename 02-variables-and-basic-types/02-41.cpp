// Exercise 2.41: Use your Sales_data class to rewrite the exercises in ยง 1.5.1
// (p. 22), ยง 1.5.2 (p. 24), and ยง 1.6 (p. 25). For now, you should define your
// Sales_data class in the same file as your main function.

// Exercise 1.20: http://www.informit.com/title/032174113 contains a copy of
// Sales_item.h in the Chapter 1 code directory. Copy that file to your working
// directory. Use it to write a program that reads a set of book sales
// transactions, writing each transaction to the standard output.

// Exercise 1.21: Write a program that reads two Sales_item objects that have
// the same ISBN and produces their sum.

// Exercise 1.22: Write a program that reads several transactions for the same
// ISBN. Write the sum of all the transactions that were read.

// Exercise 1.23: Write a program that reads several transactions and counts how
// many transactions occur for each ISBN.

// Exercise 1.24: Test the previous program by giving multiple transactions
// representing multiple ISBNs. The records for each ISBN should be grouped
// together.

// Exercise 1.25: Using the Sales_item.h header from the Web site, compile and
// execute the bookstore program presented in this section.
