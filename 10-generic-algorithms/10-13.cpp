// Exercise 10.13: The library defines an algorithm named partition that takes a
// predicate and partitions the container so that values for which the predicate
// is true appear in the first part and those for which the predicate is false
// appear in the second part. The algorithm returns an iterator just past the
// last element for which the predicate returned true. Write a function that
// takes a string and returns a bool indicating whether the string has five
// characters or more. Use that function to partition words. Print the elements
// that have five or more characters.
