// Exercise 10.27: In addition to unique (Section 10.2.3, p. 384), the library
// defines function named unique_copy that takes a third iterator denoting a
// destination into which to copy the unique elements. Write a program that uses
// unique_copy to copy the unique elements from a vector into an initially empty
// list.
