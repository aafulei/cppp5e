// Exercise 6.12: Rewrite the program from exercise 6.10 in ยง 6.2.1 (p. 210) to use references instead of pointers to swap the value of two ints. Which version do you think would be easier to use and why?

// Exercise 6.10: Using pointers, write a function to swap the values of two ints. Test the function by calling it and printing the swapped values.

// Answer: Using a reference is easier, becasue
// 1.	it is less error-prone;
// 2.	it avoids copying, which may be expensive.

#include <iostream>

using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

// XOR swap
void swap(int & a, int & b)
{
	a ^= b, b ^= a, a ^= b;
}

int main()
{
	int a, b;
	cout << "Enter two integers: ";
	cin >> a >> b;
	cout << "a = " << a << "," << " b = " << b << endl;
	swap(a, b);
	cout << "a = " << a << "," << " b = " << b << endl;
	return 0;
}
